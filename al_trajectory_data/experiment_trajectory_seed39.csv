# Recommended Next Experiment

I recommend the following parameters for your next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

- **Concentration**: 15.0% polysulfone (increase from 12.0%)
- **Auto**: Yes (maintain automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: Yes (introduce heating during mixing)
- **Heating block temperature**: 40°C
- **Mixed**: Yes (use robot mixing)
- **Rest time**: 2 days (increase from 1 day)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2.0 minutes (increase from 0.0 minutes)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (decrease from 49%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (introduce nitrogen flow)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (introduce nitrogen flow)

## Rationale
1. **Increasing polymer concentration** (12% → 15%) should increase chain entanglement and likely improve mechanical properties including modulus
2. **Adding heating during mixing** will improve polymer dissolution and homogeneity
3. **Increasing rest time** (1 → 2 days) may allow better polymer relaxation and reduce internal stresses
4. **Adding a short wait time** before immersion could promote controlled initial phase separation
5. **Reducing humidity** slightly may help control evaporation rate
6. **Adding nitrogen flow** can help control the evaporation environment and potentially improve membrane structure uniformity

This experiment represents a strategic step to explore parameters that should positively influence mechanical properties while staying within your operational ranges.",88.47667256854467,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two experiments provided, I can observe that increasing the polymer concentration from 12.0% to 14.0% resulted in a significant improvement in elastic modulus (from 42.74 to 88.48 MPa). All other parameters remained constant between these experiments.

For the next experiment, I recommend:

## Proposed Experimental Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (room temperature mixing)
- **Concentration**: 16.0% (increasing from 14.0% to continue the trend)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (room temperature)
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest time**: 1 day (maintain consistency)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 min (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 49% (maintain consistency)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

## Rationale
The data shows a clear positive correlation between polymer concentration and elastic modulus. Increasing the concentration from 12.0% to 14.0% nearly doubled the modulus. Continuing this trend by testing a 16.0% concentration while keeping other parameters constant will help determine if this relationship continues and potentially maximize the modulus further. This approach follows the principle of changing one variable at a time to clearly understand its effect on the membrane properties.",162.77817832797786,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three experiments provided, I can observe a clear trend that increasing polymer concentration leads to significantly higher elastic modulus values:

- Experiment #21: 12.0% concentration → 42.74 MPa modulus
- Experiment #22: 14.0% concentration → 88.48 MPa modulus
- Experiment #23: 16.0% concentration → 162.78 MPa modulus

This suggests a strong positive correlation between polymer concentration and modulus, with the relationship potentially being non-linear (as the increase from 14% to 16% yielded a larger modulus improvement than from 12% to 14%).

## Recommended Next Experiment

I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize modulus:

- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from the highest tested value of 16%)
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (room temperature mixing)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (room temperature)
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest time**: 1 day (consistent with previous experiments)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 49% (consistent with previous experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

2. **Nitrogen flow during drop-casting**: Experiment #29 showed significantly higher modulus (207.09 MPa) compared to similar conditions without nitrogen (88.48 MPa in Exp #22).

3. **Relative humidity**: A slight increase from 49% to 54% RH coincided with improved modulus.

2. **Relative Humidity**: The best results were obtained at 54% RH (Exps #28-30), which appears optimal compared to other humidity levels.

3. **Nitrogen Flow**: Applying nitrogen flow from the side during drop-casting (as in Exps #29-30) consistently produced higher modulus values compared to no nitrogen flow.

4. **Wait Time**: Immediate immersion (0.0 min) in the NIPS bath has been used in all successful experiments and should be maintained.

## Analysis of Previous Results

Looking at the data, I observe several trends:
- Higher polymer concentrations (15-17%) generally yield higher modulus values
- The highest modulus (272.22) was achieved with 17% concentration and a 10-minute wait time before bath immersion
- Nitrogen flow after blade casting appears beneficial for higher modulus
- Higher relative humidity (around 58%) seems favorable when combined with other optimal parameters

I recommend the following parameters for your next experiment:

- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from the previous maximum of 17%)
- **Automated**: Yes (use robotic system)
- **Heating**: No (room temperature 25°C)

- **Rest time**: 1 day
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 58%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale

This recommendation builds on experiment #56 (which achieved the highest modulus of 272.22) by:
1. Increasing polymer concentration to 18% to continue the positive trend seen between concentration and modulus
2. Maintaining the successful 10-minute wait time before bath immersion
3. Adding nitrogen flow during drop casting (in addition to after blade casting)
4. Using the optimal relative humidity of 58%
5. Utilizing the automated system for precision and reproducibility

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 58%

1. The highest modulus (272.22) was observed in Experiment #56 with 17.0% concentration, 10 minutes wait time, and nitrogen flow after blade casting.
2. Higher polymer concentrations (16-17%) consistently produced higher modulus values compared to lower concentrations (10-12%).
3. Manually premixed solutions with no rest time showed better performance than robot-mixed solutions with rest periods.
4. The 10-minute wait time before bath immersion appears critical for achieving high modulus values.
5. Nitrogen flow after blade casting, but not during side-drop, appears to be optimal for modulus enhancement.
6. A moderate relative humidity (58%) appears to work well with the other parameters.

3. **Premixed solution**: The highest modulus values were achieved with premixed solutions rather than robot-mixed ones.

4. **Zero rest time**: The experiments with the highest modulus (#55, #56) used solutions with no rest time.

5. **Extended wait time before bath immersion**: The highest modulus (272.22 MPa) was achieved with a 10-minute wait time before bath immersion, suggesting that partial solvent evaporation benefits mechanical properties.

6. **Moderate humidity**: A controlled humidity around 60% appears optimal based on the data.

7. **Nitrogen flow after blade casting**: This appears to be a critical factor in the highest-performing experiments, likely helping to control the evaporation rate.

This parameter combination builds upon the conditions that produced the highest modulus values while making a strategic increase in polymer concentration to potentially further enhance mechanical properties.",168.33383829683325,296.35081017123304,Continuing
16,57,Index: 53; Auto: True; Heating: False; Concentration: 17.0; Heating Block Temperature: 25; Mixed: False; Rest Time (days): 0; Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 10.0; Relative Humidity: 68; Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0; Nitrogen (After blade): 0,"# Recommendation for Next Experiment to Maximize Modulus

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters:
- **Auto**: Yes (fully automated process)
- **Heating**: No (room temperature 25°C)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from the highest tested value of 17.0%)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (ambient)
- **Mixed**: No (use premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 58-60%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale:
1. The highest modulus values (272.22, 219.62) were observed with 17% polymer concentration and 10-minute wait times.
2. Premixed solutions (not robot-mixed) consistently showed higher modulus values.
3. No heating appears optimal based on the best-performing experiments.
4. Immediate use (0 days rest time) was common in the highest-performing experiments.
5. Applying nitrogen after blade casting but not during side drop appears to be beneficial.
6. Moderate humidity (58-60%) seems to produce better results than very high humidity.
7. Increasing concentration to 18% (slightly above the highest tested value) may further improve modulus while staying within reasonable processing limits.

This recommendation aims to build upon the conditions that produced the highest modulus values while making a strategic increase in polymer concentration.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
