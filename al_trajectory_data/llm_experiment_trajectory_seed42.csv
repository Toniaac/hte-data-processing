Based on the single data point provided (Experiment ID 12), I'll recommend parameters that are likely to increase the elastic modulus for your next experiment.

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment:
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 15% polysulfone (increased from 10%)
- **Heating**: Yes (apply heating during mixing)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (reduced from 2 days)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2 minutes (increased from 0 minutes)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (decreased from 56%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale:
1. **Higher polymer concentration** (15% vs 10%) typically leads to denser membrane structures with higher mechanical strength
2. **Heating during mixing** can improve polymer dissolution and solution homogeneity
3. **Shorter rest time** (1 day vs 2 days) may prevent potential polymer aggregation
4. **Adding a short wait time** before immersion allows partial solvent evaporation, creating a denser skin layer
5. **Lower humidity** can control the initial phase separation rate
6. **Adding nitrogen flow** during and after casting helps control the initial phase separation and creates more uniform structures

This recommendation aims to create a denser, more mechanically robust membrane structure while maintaining good control over the phase separation process.",220.5104016857166,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two experimental observations provided, I can see that Experiment #30 achieved a significantly higher modulus (220.51) compared to Experiment #12 (39.59). The key differences that likely contributed to this improvement include:

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment:

1. **Concentration**: 18.0% polysulfone (increasing from 16.0% in Exp #30)
   - Higher polymer concentration appears to correlate with higher modulus

2. **Auto**: Yes (maintain automated synthesis)

3. **Heating**: Yes (introduce heating during mixing)
   - Recommend heating block temperature of 40°C to improve polymer dissolution

4. **Mixed**: Yes (maintain robotic mixing)

5. **Rest time**: 1 day (maintain the same as Exp #30)
   - The shorter rest time of 1 day in Exp #30 vs 2 days in Exp #12 may be beneficial

6. **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 min (maintain immediate immersion)

7. **Relative Humidity**: 50% (slightly lower than previous experiments)
   - Control humidity more precisely for better reproducibility

8. **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (maintain as in Exp #30)
   - This appears to be beneficial for modulus

9. **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (introduce this parameter)
   - Adding nitrogen flow after blade casting may further improve membrane structure

This parameter set builds on the successful conditions from Experiment #30 while introducing controlled heating and post-blade nitrogen flow to potentially further enhance the modulus.",207.09310351510177,296.35081017123304,Continuing

## Recommended Next Experiment

I recommend the following parameters to maximize modulus:

Based on the prior experimental data, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (room temperature processing)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% polysulfone

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.2 minutes (12 seconds)
- **Relative Humidity**: 70%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. **Higher polymer concentration**: The data shows a strong correlation between higher polymer concentration and higher modulus (Exp #30 with 16% had 220.51 MPa, Exp #23 with 16% had 162.78 MPa, while Exp #12 with 10% had only 39.59 MPa).

2. **Premixed solution**: Experiment #50 with a premixed solution (not robot-mixed) showed excellent results (197.84 MPa).

3. **No rest time**: Experiment #50 with 0 days rest time performed very well, suggesting immediate use may be beneficial.

4. **Higher humidity**: The highest modulus values were observed at higher humidity levels (Exp #50 at 70% RH performed well).

5. **Nitrogen flow control**: Using nitrogen flow both during drop-casting and after blade-casting should provide optimal humidity control throughout the process.

6. **Short wait time**: A brief wait time (0.2 minutes) before immersion in the NIPS bath appears beneficial based on Experiment #50.

This parameter combination builds upon the successful conditions from the highest-performing experiments while pushing the polymer concentration slightly higher to potentially achieve even greater modulus values.",168.33383829683325,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Concentration**: 18.0% polysulfone (increasing from the highest tested value of 17.0%)
- **Heating**: No (all high-modulus experiments used no heating)
- **Mixed**: No (use premixed solution as in experiments #50 and #51)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (immediate use showed good results in experiments #50 and #51)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.5 minutes (intermediate between the 0.17 min of #50 and 1.0 min of #51)
- **Relative Humidity**: 70% (highest value tested, which yielded good results)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (to control humidity during initial casting)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (to control humidity during the wait time)

## Rationale

2. The highest modulus values were observed with premixed solutions used immediately (0 days rest)
3. Nitrogen flow control appears beneficial, especially at higher humidity levels
4. A moderate wait time between casting and bath immersion may help optimize phase separation
5. The highest humidity tested (70%) produced good results when combined with nitrogen flow control
