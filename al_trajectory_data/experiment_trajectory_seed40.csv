# Recommended Next Experiment

## Experiment Parameters:

- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Solution**: 19.0% polysulfone in PolarClean solvent (increased concentration)
- **Solution Preparation**: With heating (Heating: Yes), heating block temperature: 60°C
- **Solution Preparation Method**: Robot-mixed (Mixed: Yes)
- **Solution Rest Time**: 1 day
- **Casting Conditions**:
  - 8.0 minute wait time between coupon casting and NIPS bath immersion
  - 65% relative humidity during synthesis
  - No nitrogen flow during drop-casting (Nitrogen Side from drop: No)
  - Laminar dry nitrogen flow applied after blade-casting (Nitrogen After blade: Yes)

## Rationale:

1. **Increased polymer concentration** (19% vs 17%): Higher polymer concentrations typically lead to denser membrane structures with improved mechanical properties.

2. **Added heating during preparation**: Heating improves polymer dissolution and distribution, potentially creating more uniform structures with better mechanical integrity.

3. **Robot-mixed solution**: This should provide more consistent mixing than manual preparation, reducing variability.

4. **1-day rest time**: Allowing the solution to rest may help eliminate air bubbles and allow polymer chains to reach equilibrium configurations.

5. **Slightly reduced wait time** (8 min vs 10 min): This adjustment may help optimize the initial phase separation process.

6. **Maintained high humidity** (65%): The previous experiment used high humidity (68%), which may have contributed to the good modulus result.

7. **Maintained nitrogen flow after blade-casting**: This appears to be beneficial for controlling evaporation and the initial phase separation process.",219.61643412334288,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two previous experiments (Index 54 and 55), I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experimental Parameters

- **Auto**: Yes (Automated robotic system)
- **Heating**: Yes (Add heating during solution preparation)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (Increase polymer concentration slightly)
- **Heating block temperature**: 40°C
- **Mixed**: No (Use premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 1 day (Allow some solution aging)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes (Maintain the longer wait time)
- **Relative Humidity**: 65% (Slightly lower than previous experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (Maintain laminar nitrogen flow after blade casting)

## Rationale

1. Both previous experiments showed good modulus values with 17% concentration, but increasing to 18% may further enhance mechanical properties.
2. Adding heating during preparation could improve polymer dissolution and distribution.
3. A short rest time (1 day) may allow better polymer chain entanglement without degradation.
4. The 10-minute wait time before bath immersion appears beneficial for modulus development.
5. Maintaining nitrogen flow after blade casting helps control the initial phase separation process.
6. Slightly reducing humidity may provide more controlled solvent evaporation.

This recommendation aims to build upon the successful aspects of previous experiments while making targeted adjustments to potentially increase the elastic modulus.",272.2240045816517,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three previous experiments, I can identify trends that suggest how to maximize the elastic modulus of the membrane:

## Analysis of Previous Results:
- Experiment 54: Modulus = 211.51 MPa (RH = 68%)
- Experiment 55: Modulus = 219.62 MPa (RH = 68%)
- Experiment 56: Modulus = 272.22 MPa (RH = 58%)

The most significant improvement in modulus occurred when the relative humidity was reduced from 68% to 58%, resulting in a substantial increase in modulus (>50 MPa). All other parameters remained consistent across these experiments.

## Recommended Next Experiment:

- **Index**: 57
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No
- **Concentration**: 17.0% (maintain the successful concentration)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (ambient)
- **Mixed**: No (use premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 48% (further reduce humidity to continue the promising trend)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale:
The data shows a clear inverse relationship between relative humidity and elastic modulus. By further reducing the relative humidity to 48% while maintaining all other parameters, we can test if this trend continues. The 10-minute wait time before bath immersion appears beneficial for developing higher modulus membranes, and the post-blade nitrogen flow likely helps control the phase separation process.",228.4671903908735,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the previous experimental data, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (Automated robotic system)
- **Heating**: No (Ambient temperature 25°C)
- **Concentration**: 17.0% polysulfone
- **Heating block temperature**: N/A (no heating)
- **Mixed**: No (Premixed manually)
- **Rest time**: 1 day
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 55%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (272.22) was observed in experiment #56, which had 58% relative humidity, 10-minute wait time, and nitrogen flow after blade casting.

2. Experiment #72 with 1-day rest time showed good modulus (228.47) despite 0-minute wait time and no nitrogen flow.

3. All successful experiments used 17.0% polymer concentration, so I'm maintaining this parameter.

4. I'm recommending 55% relative humidity as it's between the values of experiments #56 (58%) and #72 (50%), slightly favoring the conditions of the highest-performing experiment.

5. The 10-minute wait time appears beneficial based on experiments #54, #55, and #56, which all showed good modulus values.

6. Nitrogen flow after blade casting appears to be beneficial based on the highest-performing experiment.

This recommendation combines the most promising parameters from the previous experiments to potentially achieve an even higher modulus value.",220.5104016857166,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters

- **Solution Preparation**: Premixed manually without heating (Mixed: No, Heating: No)

- **Solution Rest Time**: 1 day
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 5.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 55%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (272.22) was observed in experiment #56 with 17% concentration, 10 min wait time, 58% RH, and nitrogen after blade.
2. Increasing polymer concentration slightly to 18% may further enhance mechanical properties.
3. A moderate wait time (5 min) balances between immediate immersion and extended evaporation time.
4. Adding nitrogen flow during drop casting (as in experiment #30) while maintaining it after blade casting combines beneficial aspects of both approaches.
5. The 55% relative humidity is in the optimal range based on experiments #56 and #72.
6. Including a 1-day rest time (as in experiments #30 and #72) appears to contribute to consistent mechanical properties.

This parameter set strategically combines the most promising conditions from previous experiments while making targeted adjustments to potentially maximize the elastic modulus.",140.76871335709305,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system
- **Polymer Solution**: 18.0% polysulfone in PolarClean solvent (increasing concentration from 17%)
- **Solution Preparation**: Premixed manually without heating (ambient temperature 25°C)
- **Solution Rest Time**: 1 day
- **Casting Conditions**:
  - 5.0 minute wait time between coupon casting and NIPS bath immersion
  - 55% relative humidity during synthesis
  - No nitrogen flow during drop-casting
  - Laminar dry nitrogen flow applied after blade-casting until bath immersion

## Rationale
1. **Concentration**: The highest modulus (272.22) was observed with 17% concentration. I'm recommending a slight increase to 18% to explore if higher polymer content further improves mechanical properties.

2. **Rest time**: Experiment #72 with 1 day rest time showed good modulus (228.47), suggesting some solution aging may be beneficial.

3. **Wait time**: The highest modulus was observed with 10 minutes wait time, but I'm recommending 5 minutes as a compromise between the 10 minutes (which gave 272.22 modulus) and 0 minutes to optimize processing time while maintaining good properties.

4. **Humidity**: 58% humidity yielded the highest modulus (272.22), so I'm recommending a similar value (55%).

5. **Nitrogen flow**: Applying nitrogen after blade-casting appears beneficial, as seen in experiment #56 with the highest modulus.

## Rationale
1. **Concentration**: The highest modulus (272.22) was observed with 17% concentration. Increasing to 18% may further enhance mechanical properties while staying within reasonable processing limits.

2. **Wait Time**: The 10-minute wait time before bath immersion consistently produced higher modulus values (experiments #54, #55, #56) compared to immediate immersion.

3. **Humidity**: A moderate humidity (55-58%) appears optimal based on experiment #56 (272.22 modulus at 58% RH).

4. **Solution Rest**: Using the solution immediately (0 days rest) produced better results than 1-day rest periods.

5. **Nitrogen Flow**: Applying nitrogen flow after blade casting but not during drop casting showed the best results (experiment #56).

5. Moderate humidity (55%) is selected as a balance point that has shown good results.

2. **Wait Time**: The experiment with the highest modulus (Exp #56) used a 10-minute wait time. I'm recommending 8 minutes to optimize between this successful long wait time and shorter times.

3. **Humidity**: Setting to 55% as a middle ground between experiments that showed good results (58% in Exp #56 with highest modulus, and 50-54% in other successful experiments).

4. **Nitrogen Flow**: Applying nitrogen after blade casting but not during drop casting, which matches the configuration in the experiment with the highest modulus.

5. **Rest Time**: Using the solution immediately (0 days) as this was the case in the experiments with the highest modulus values.

Based on the provided experimental data, I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus.

## Analysis of Previous Results
- The highest modulus (272.22 MPa) was achieved in experiment #56 with:
  - 17.0% polymer concentration
  - No heating during preparation
  - Premixed solution (not robot-mixed)
  - 0 days rest time
  - 10 minutes coupon-to-bath wait time
  - 58% relative humidity
  - No nitrogen during drop casting
  - Nitrogen after blade casting

- Other high modulus values were observed with:
  - 17.0% concentration (experiments #54, #55, #56)
  - Longer coupon-to-bath wait times (10 minutes)
  - Nitrogen flow after blade casting
  - Relative humidity in the 58-68% range

- Lower modulus values were associated with:
  - Lower polymer concentrations (10-15%)
  - Immediate bath immersion (0 minutes wait time)

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters

- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% (slightly increasing from the best result)
- **Heating**: No (consistent with best results)
- **Mixed by Robot**: No (use premixed solution)
- **Rest Time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (within the optimal range observed)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

This recommendation builds on the successful parameters from experiment #56 while slightly increasing the polymer concentration, which appears to have a strong positive correlation with modulus. The extended wait time before bath immersion (10 minutes) appears critical for achieving high modulus values, likely by allowing partial solvent evaporation that affects the final membrane structure.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
