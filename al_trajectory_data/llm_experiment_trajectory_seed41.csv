# Recommended Next Experiment

## Experiment Parameters:
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 19.0% (increasing from 17.0%)
- **Heating**: Yes (adding heating during solution preparation)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C
- **Mixed**: No (continue using pre-mixed polymer solution)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (adding rest time to allow better polymer chain organization)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2 minutes (adding a short evaporation period)
- **Relative Humidity**: 50% (reducing from 82% to a more controlled level)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (adding nitrogen flow for better environmental control)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (adding nitrogen flow for controlled evaporation)

## Rationale:
1. **Increased polymer concentration** (19% vs 17%) should increase chain entanglement and potentially improve mechanical properties
2. **Adding heating** during preparation may improve polymer dissolution and distribution
3. **Adding rest time** (1 day) allows polymer chains to reach equilibrium configurations
4. **Controlled humidity** (50% vs 82%) may provide better phase separation kinetics
5. **Short evaporation period** (2 min wait time) before immersion can enhance skin layer formation
6. **Nitrogen flow** provides controlled atmosphere during critical formation stages

This experiment represents a significant but measured deviation from your baseline to explore parameters likely to increase modulus while remaining within typical operational ranges for NIPS membrane formation.",228.4671903908735,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior experiments, I can make the following observations:

1. Experiment #72 achieved a higher modulus (228.47) compared to Experiment #38 (171.0)
2. Key differences that may have contributed to this improvement:
   - Reduced humidity (50% vs 82%)
   - 1-day rest time vs no rest time
   - Both used the same polymer concentration (17%)

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters

I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize modulus:

- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: Yes (apply heating during solution preparation)
- **Concentration**: 19% (increase polymer concentration)
- **Heating block temperature**: 60°C
- **Mixed**: No (use pre-mixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 2 days (increase rest time)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (further reduce humidity)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (add nitrogen flow)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (add nitrogen flow)

## Rationale

This recommendation builds on the successful elements from Experiment #72 while introducing additional modifications that may further enhance modulus:

1. Increased polymer concentration (19%) should increase chain entanglement and resulting mechanical properties
2. Adding heating during preparation should improve polymer dissolution and solution homogeneity
3. Extended rest time (2 days) may allow better polymer relaxation and organization
4. Further reduced humidity (40%) to minimize moisture effects during casting
5. Adding nitrogen flow to create a more controlled atmosphere during casting

These parameters remain within the typical ranges for NIPS membrane synthesis while strategically targeting conditions that should maximize modulus based on the observed trend between experiments #38 and #72.",88.47667256854467,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three previous experiments, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus of the membranes:

## Key Observations:
1. **Polymer Concentration**: Higher concentration (17%) yielded higher modulus values (171.0 and 228.47) compared to lower concentration (14%, yielding 88.48)
2. **Rest Time**: 1 day rest time appears beneficial (228.47 with rest vs. 171.0 without rest at same concentration)
3. **Humidity**: Moderate humidity (50%) seems preferable to very high humidity (82%)
4. **Pre-mixing**: Manually pre-mixed solutions performed better than robot-mixed solutions

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Polymer Concentration**: 20% (increasing from 17% to explore upper range)
- **Heating**: Yes (introduce heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 50°C (moderate heating)
- **Mixed**: No (use manually pre-mixed solution as this performed better)
- **Rest Time**: 2 days (extending from 1 day to see if longer rest further improves properties)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion worked well previously)
- **Relative Humidity**: 45% (slightly lower than previous successful experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This experiment pushes toward higher polymer concentration while incorporating the beneficial rest time and controlled humidity conditions observed in previous successful experiments.",64.29918271351211,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 20% (increasing from the 17% that showed good results)
- **Heating**: Yes
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C (increasing from 50°C to potentially improve polymer dissolution)
- **Mixed**: No (use pre-mixed solution as it showed better results in experiment #72)
- **Rest Time**: 2 days (extending from the 1 day that showed good results in experiment #72)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion consistently showed good results)
- **Relative Humidity**: 45% (controlled lower humidity, as experiment #72 with 50% RH showed better results than #38 with 82% RH)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

## Rationale
1. Higher polymer concentration (20%) should increase mechanical strength based on the trend observed (17% performed better than 14% and 11.63%)
2. Pre-mixed solution with rest time showed the highest modulus (228.47 MPa in experiment #72)
3. Adding heating while increasing rest time may improve polymer chain entanglement
4. Controlled humidity around 45-50% appears optimal based on prior results
5. Immediate immersion in the NIPS bath consistently produced better results

This parameter combination builds upon the conditions that produced the highest modulus (experiment #72) while strategically adjusting key parameters that appear to influence mechanical properties.",90.99870959544364,296.35081017123304,Continuing

- **Rest Time**: 2 days
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (228.47) was observed with 17% polymer concentration, premixed solution, 1 day rest time, and 50% humidity.
2. Increasing the polymer concentration to 19% should further enhance the modulus as higher concentrations typically yield stronger membranes.
3. Adding heating during preparation while using a premixed solution combines beneficial aspects from multiple experiments.
4. Extending the rest time to 2 days may allow better polymer chain entanglement and solution homogeneity.
5. Maintaining a moderate humidity (45%) appears optimal based on the data.
6. Immediate immersion in the NIPS bath (0 min wait time) consistently produced better results across experiments.

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that suggest how to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Key Observations:
1. Higher polymer concentration correlates with higher modulus:
   - 17.0% concentration yielded the highest modulus values (228.47 and 171.0)
   - 15.0% yielded 140.77
   - 14.0% yielded 88.48
   - 11.63% yielded the lowest values (91.0 and 64.3)

2. Rest time appears beneficial:
   - The highest modulus (228.47) was achieved with 1 day rest time
   - Experiments with 1 day rest generally outperformed those with 0 days

3. Premixing vs. robot mixing:
   - The highest modulus (228.47) used premixed solution
   - Robot-mixed solutions generally showed lower modulus

4. Humidity impact:
   - Moderate humidity (50%) appears optimal compared to very high humidity (82%)

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Polymer Concentration**: 20% (pushing to the upper limit of the range)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature of 25°C)
- **Mixed**: No (use manually premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 2 days (extending beyond the 1 day that showed good results)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 50% (maintain the optimal humidity level)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This experiment pushes the polymer concentration higher while maintaining the other conditions that produced the highest modulus in previous experiments, with a slightly extended rest time to potentially further improve polymer chain organization.",168.33383829683325,296.35081017123304,Continuing

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.5 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 50% (controlled environment)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (228.47) was observed in Experiment #72 with 17% concentration, premixed solution, 1 day rest, and 50% humidity.
2. Increasing the concentration slightly to 18% may further enhance the modulus, as higher concentrations (17%) consistently outperformed lower ones.
3. Pre-mixed solutions appear to yield better results than robot-mixed solutions.
4. Extending the rest time to 2 days might allow for better polymer chain entanglement and solution homogeneity.
5. Adding a short wait time (0.5 min) before bath immersion combined with nitrogen flow after blade casting may help control the initial phase separation process.
6. Maintaining moderate humidity (50%) appears optimal based on prior results.

4. A rest time of 1 day appears beneficial compared to no rest time.
5. Moderate humidity (50%) seems preferable to very high humidity (70-82%).
6. Applying nitrogen after blade casting appears to improve modulus.
