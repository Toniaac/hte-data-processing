# Recommended Next Experiment

## Experiment Parameters:
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 19.0% (increasing from 17.0%)
- **Heating**: Yes (adding heating during solution preparation)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C
- **Mixed**: No (continue using pre-mixed polymer solution)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (adding rest time to allow better polymer chain organization)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2 minutes (adding a short evaporation period)
- **Relative Humidity**: 50% (reducing from 82% to a more controlled level)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (adding nitrogen flow for better environmental control)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (adding nitrogen flow for controlled evaporation)

## Rationale:
1. **Increased polymer concentration** (19% vs 17%) should increase chain entanglement and potentially improve mechanical properties
2. **Adding heating** during preparation may improve polymer dissolution and distribution
3. **Adding rest time** (1 day) allows polymer chains to reach equilibrium configurations
4. **Controlled humidity** (50% vs 82%) may provide better phase separation kinetics
5. **Short evaporation period** (2 min wait time) before immersion can enhance skin layer formation
6. **Nitrogen flow** provides controlled atmosphere during critical formation stages

This experiment represents a significant but measured deviation from your baseline to explore parameters likely to increase modulus while remaining within typical operational ranges for NIPS membrane formation.",228.4671903908735,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior experiments, I can make the following observations:

1. Experiment #72 achieved a higher modulus (228.47) compared to Experiment #38 (171.0)
2. Key differences that may have contributed to this improvement:
   - Reduced humidity (50% vs 82%)
   - 1-day rest time vs no rest time
   - Both used the same polymer concentration (17%)

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters

I recommend the following parameters to maximize modulus:

- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: Yes (add heating during solution preparation)
- **Concentration**: 19% (increase polymer concentration)
- **Heating block temperature**: 60°C
- **Mixed**: No (manually pre-mix the solution)
- **Rest time**: 2 days (extend rest time)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (further reduce humidity)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (add nitrogen flow)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (add nitrogen flow)

## Rationale

1. The higher modulus in Experiment #72 suggests that lower humidity and rest time are beneficial
2. Increasing polymer concentration should increase mechanical strength
3. Adding heating during preparation may improve polymer dissolution and solution homogeneity
4. Adding nitrogen flow can help control the phase inversion process and reduce defects
5. Further reducing humidity may continue the positive trend seen between experiments #38 and #72
6. Extending rest time from 1 to 2 days may allow better polymer chain relaxation and organization

This combination of parameters aims to build upon the improvements seen in Experiment #72 while introducing additional modifications that should theoretically enhance membrane modulus.",140.76871335709305,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three previous experiments, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

## Key Observations:
1. The highest modulus (228.47 MPa) was achieved with Experiment #72, which used:
   - 17% polymer concentration
   - Premixed solution (not robot-mixed)
   - 1 day rest time
   - 50% relative humidity
   - No heating, no nitrogen flow

2. Comparing Experiments #71 and #72:
   - Increasing polymer concentration from 15% to 17% significantly improved modulus (140.77 → 228.47 MPa)
   - Other parameters were identical

3. Comparing Experiments #38 and #72:
   - Adding 1 day rest time improved modulus (171.0 → 228.47 MPa)
   - Reducing humidity from 82% to 50% may have been beneficial

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Polymer Concentration**: 19% (increase from best result)
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated
- **Heating**: No
- **Mixed**: No (use premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 2 days (increase from best result)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (slight decrease from best result)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This recommendation builds on the best performing experiment (#72) by further increasing polymer concentration and rest time while slightly decreasing humidity, which appear to be the most influential parameters for maximizing modulus based on the available data.",188.55697291016554,296.35081017123304,Continuing

1. The highest modulus (228.47 MPa) was observed in Experiment #72, which used 17% polymer concentration, 1 day rest time, and 50% relative humidity.

2. Comparing Experiments #38 and #72, both used 17% concentration, but #72 had a significantly higher modulus (228.47 vs 171.0). The key differences were:
   - Rest time (1 day in #72 vs 0 in #38)
   - Relative humidity (50% in #72 vs 82% in #38)

3. Experiment #71 with 15% concentration showed the lowest modulus (140.77), suggesting that higher polymer concentration (17%) is favorable.

4. Pre-mixed solutions appear to perform better than robot-mixed solutions based on the available data.

This recommendation aims to replicate the conditions of the best-performing experiment (#72) while maintaining the parameters that appear to positively influence the elastic modulus.",197.84044623035882,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I'll analyze the patterns in the data to recommend parameters that are likely to maximize the elastic modulus.

## Key Observations from Previous Experiments:
- Experiment #72 achieved the highest modulus (228.47 MPa) with 17% polymer concentration, 1 day rest time, 50% humidity, and no nitrogen flow
- Experiment #30 had the second highest modulus (220.51 MPa) with 16% concentration, 1 day rest time, 54% humidity, and nitrogen flow during drop casting

## Analysis of Previous Results
- Highest modulus (228.47 MPa) was achieved in Experiment #72 with 17% polymer concentration, 1 day rest time, 50% RH, and no nitrogen flow
- Second highest modulus (220.51 MPa) was in Experiment #30 with 16% concentration, 1 day rest time, 54% RH, and nitrogen flow during drop casting
- Low concentration (10% in Experiment #20) resulted in very low modulus (28.09 MPa)
- Higher humidity (82% in Experiments #37-38) produced lower modulus compared to moderate humidity (50-54%)

## Rationale
This recommendation builds on the successful conditions from Experiments #72 and #30, which produced the highest modulus values. I've increased the polymer concentration slightly to 18% since the data suggests higher concentrations (15-17%) yield better mechanical properties. The 1-day rest time appears optimal based on previous results.

3. **Humidity control**: Experiments with moderate humidity (50-54%) outperformed those with high humidity (82%).

4. **Nitrogen flow**: Applying nitrogen flow during drop casting showed benefits (Exp #30 with 220.51 MPa). I recommend adding nitrogen flow after blade casting as well, as this combination hasn't been fully explored but shows promise based on partial implementations.

5. **Pre-mixed solution**: The highest modulus (228.47 MPa) was achieved with a pre-mixed solution rather than robot-mixed.

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 60%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. **Concentration (17%)**: The highest modulus values were consistently observed with 17% polymer concentration (Exp #56: 272.22 MPa, Exp #72: 228.47 MPa).

2. **Wait Time (10 minutes)**: Experiment #56 with a 10-minute wait time produced the highest modulus (272.22 MPa), significantly higher than similar experiments with shorter wait times.

3. **Nitrogen after blade**: Experiments that applied nitrogen after blade casting generally showed improved modulus values, likely by controlling humidity during the critical phase separation initiation.

4. **No rest time**: While some experiments with 1-day rest showed good results, the highest modulus (Exp #56: 272.22 MPa) was achieved with no rest time.

5. **Relative Humidity (60%)**: Setting this slightly higher than some experiments but lower than the highest humidity tests to maintain optimal conditions for phase separation.

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus observed (272.22 MPa) was in Experiment #56, which used 17% concentration, 10-minute wait time, and nitrogen after blade casting.

2. Concentration appears critical - experiments with 17% concentration consistently showed higher modulus values compared to lower concentrations (10-14%).

3. The coupon-to-bath wait time of 10 minutes appears optimal, as seen in experiments #55 and #56, which produced the highest modulus values.

4. Nitrogen flow after blade casting (but not during side drop) appears beneficial for modulus enhancement.

5. Using premixed solutions rather than robot-mixed solutions seems to yield better results.

6. No rest time (immediate use after preparation) appears preferable based on the highest-performing experiments.

7. I've selected 60% relative humidity as a middle value between experiments #55 and #56 (which had 68% and 58% RH respectively) to optimize this parameter.
