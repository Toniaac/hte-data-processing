The previous composition showed high yield strength (1296 MPa) with notable amounts of Cr, Ni, Al, and Mo. However, I notice the Fe content (75.2%) was below the allowed range (0.62-0.86), and the C content (0.138%) was above the maximum allowed (0.0201).

For my recommendation, I'll:
1. Increase Fe to within the allowed range
2. Maintain high levels of Cr, Ni, and Mo (within limits)
3. Keep Al high for precipitation hardening
4. Maximize V and Nb for grain refinement
5. Adjust C to maximum allowed value
