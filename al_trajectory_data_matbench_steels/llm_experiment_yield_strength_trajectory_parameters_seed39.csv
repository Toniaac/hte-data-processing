My suggested steel composition:

Fe: 0.670000
C: 0.001000
Mn: 0.001500
Si: 0.005000
Cr: 0.010000
Ni: 0.190000
Mo: 0.030000
V: 0.005000
Nb: 0.001000
Co: 0.090000
Al: 0.022000
Ti: 0.010000
N: 0.000500
W: 0.005000

This composition maintains the high nickel content that appeared beneficial in the prior observation while slightly increasing cobalt. I've moderately increased chromium, vanadium, and niobium which are known to form strengthening carbides and nitrides. The carbon content is increased slightly to support these carbide formations, and I've introduced small amounts of nitrogen and tungsten for additional solid solution strengthening.",2381.6,2510.3,Continuing

I notice that the second composition had a significantly higher yield strength (2381.6 MPa vs 1309.1 MPa), so I'll use that as a primary guide while making strategic adjustments.

Suggested next composition to test:

Fe: 0.660000
C: 0.000500
Mn: 0.001000
Si: 0.002000
Cr: 0.000150
Ni: 0.180000
Mo: 0.025000
V: 0.000500
Nb: 0.000100
Co: 0.130000
Al: 0.003000
Ti: 0.020000
N: 0.000100
W: 0.000500

This composition builds on the higher-performing second sample by:
1) Slightly increasing Ti content
2) Increasing Co content while keeping it below the maximum observed value
3) Slightly increasing V, Nb, and adding small amounts of N and W
4) Maintaining similar levels of Fe, Ni, and Mo that appeared beneficial
5) Keeping Al low as in the second sample",2510.3,2510.3,Max yield strength reached
