The data shows that maraging-type steels with high nickel, cobalt, titanium, and molybdenum content consistently demonstrate the highest yield strengths, with values exceeding 2000 MPa in several cases.

My suggested composition is:

Fe: 0.650000
Ni: 0.177000
Co: 0.126000
Ti: 0.025000
Mo: 0.020000
Al: 0.001000
V: 0.000500
Nb: 0.000300
C: 0.000100
Si: 0.000100
Mn: 0.000100
Cr: 0.000100
N: 0.000000
W: 0.000000

This composition is designed to maximize yield strength by:
1. Using high nickel content (17.7%) to promote martensite formation
2. Including high cobalt (12.6%) to enhance precipitation kinetics
3. Maximizing titanium (2.5%) for Ni???Ti precipitate formation
4. Adding significant molybdenum (2%) for additional precipitation strengthening
5. Including small amounts of aluminum, vanadium, and niobium for grain refinement
6. Keeping carbon very low to focus on intermetallic precipitation rather than carbide formation

This composition closely resembles the samples that demonstrated yield strengths above 2300 MPa in the prior observations.",2510.3,Max yield strength reached,2510.3
