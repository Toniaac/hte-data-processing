   abstract = {Membrane deformation under an applied hydraulic pressure, often termed compaction, is observed in almost all pressure-driven membrane processes. Most notably, compaction decreases water permeability in conventional reverse osmosis (RO) and is expected to critically hinder high-pressure reverse osmosis (HPRO) for hypersaline brine desalination. In this work, we demonstrated that compaction decreases the water permeability of commercial RO membranes from 2.0 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 at 70 bar applied hydraulic pressure to 1.3 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 at 150 bar. The morphological effects of compaction were primarily associated with changes in the support layer, where a ~60% decrease in cross-sectional thickness is observed following compaction at 150 bar hydraulic pressure. In contrast, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy demonstrates that the selective layer does not compact irreversibly. The mechanism that drives compaction was found to be the difference in hydraulic pressure across the interface of the selective and support layers. We further found that compaction can reduce the support layer surface porosity by up to ~95%. This decreased porosity is identified as the cause for compaction-induced water permeability decline, while the intrinsic permeability of the selective layer is not influenced by compaction. As such, we conclude that compaction of the support layer has an inextricable impact on composite membrane performance. Finally, we propose recommendations for developing compaction-resistant membranes that can maintain high water permeability, and thus good desalination performance, in high-pressure membrane applications, such as HPRO.},

   abstract = {<p>Water is essential for sustaining life and required for carrying out basic daily activities. Even though water covers the vast majority of the earth’s surface, the availability of fresh water, which is necessary to maintain human activities, is limited, making it a scarce resource. Climate change, overexploitation of groundwater, and population growth are all putting significant pressure on natural water sources, which pose a serious threat to various sectors of society, especially in agriculture. Future projections of freshwater availability indicate agriculture production will suffer a significant shock globally, including in India, leading to a threat to food security and sustainability. To ensure the sustainability of this vital resource, it is crucial to use water sensibly. Moreover, it is essential to adopt certain strategies to manage agricultural water use effectively. This includes adopting various water-efficient techniques such as ‘micro-irrigation’, ‘irrigation scheduling’, ‘conservation agriculture’, ‘crop switching’ and so on. In this review, firstly, we discuss water scarcity and its types, causes, crisis for water shortages and hindrance to sustainable development from a global perspective emphasizing the Indian scenario as a developing nation. Secondly, we elaborated our discussion on water scarcity in agriculture including the impacts of water scarcity on agricultural production and its connection to climate change, population growth, and overexploitation of natural resources globally focusing on the Indian scenario. In addition, innovative water management practices and adaptation strategies to manage agricultural water use, constraints, and the need for further research are also covered. It is anticipated that this review will benefit researchers and policymakers by providing useful information on the impacts of water limitation and adoption strategies.</p>},

abstract = {Due to the limited availability of freshwater supplies, desalination has become an increasingly reliable process for water supply worldwide, with proved technical and economic feasibility and advantages. Recently, desalination capacity significantly increased from approximately 35 million m3 daily (MCM/day) in 2005 to about 95 MCM/day in 2018. Seawater desalination accounts for about 61% of global desalination capacity, while brackish water desalination accounts for 30%. Membrane desalination, mainly using reverse osmosis (RO), accounts for ¾ of global desalination capacity, with the rest mostly used for thermal desalination using multi-stage flash distillation (MSF), and multi-effect distillation (MED). Despite the undeniable role of desalination for securing water supply in areas where natural freshwater supplies are scarce, desalination impacts the natural environment at different aspects. Environmental impacts (EIs) of the desalination process are different and vary significantly according to the nature of the utilized feedwater, the desalination technology in use, and the management of waste brine generated. In this work, the EIs of each desalination technology were thoroughly investigated, with careful consideration given to different feedwater qualities, and various brine management techniques. Although the different aspects of desalination EIs have been extensively studied in the literature, the literature lacks comprehensive reviews and summaries of all the associated EIs. This article compiles the different EIs associated with the whole desalination process in one-hub, applying an intake-to-outfall approach. The leading desalination technologies of RO, MSF, and MED were analyzed, along with different feedwaters. This article provides a mapping of the different technologies involving feedwater and brine management techniques and a detailed description of their impact on the environment. Finally, recommendations and conclusions were given to minimize the negative impacts of desalination on both the local and global environments.}

This chapter presents some basic concepts related to membranes and membrane processes. Porous membranes are divided into two types according to their structures: microporous membranes and asymmetric membranes. Microporous membranes are characterized by the membrane pores throughout the membrane bodies. The pores are of uniform size (isotropic) or nonuniform size (anisotropic). Microporous membranes are designed to reject all the species above their ratings. In terms of materials, membranes can be classified into polymeric or organic membranes and ceramic or inorganic membranes. Organic membranes are usually made up of various polymers, among which the typical ones are cellulose acetate (CA), polyamide (PA), polysulfone (PS), polyethersulfone (PES), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polypropylene (PP). Polymeric membranes are relatively cheap, easy to manufacture, available in a wide range of pore sizes, and they have been widely used in various industries. Inorganic membranes with the high mechanical strength and chemical and thermal stability over the conventional polymeric membranes have extended the application of membrane technology into many new areas. Membrane module is the way the membrane is arranged into devices and hardware to separate the feed stream into permeate and retentate streams. There are four kinds of membrane modules widely used in industry: tubular modules, hollow fiber modules, flat sheet modules, and spiral-wound modules.}

   abstract = {Water scarcity, expected to become more widespread in the coming years, demands renewed attention to freshwater protection and management. Critical to this effort is the minimization of freshwater withdrawals and elimination of wastewater discharge, both which can be achieved via zero liquid discharge (ZLD), an aggressive wastewater management approach. Because of the high energetic cost of thermal desalination, ZLD is particularly challenging for high-salinity wastewaters. In this review, we discuss the potential of high pressure reverse osmosis (HPRO) (i.e., reverse osmosis operated at hydraulic pressure greater than ~100 bar) to efficiently desalinate hypersaline brines. We first discuss the inherent energy-efficiency of membrane processes as compared to conventional thermal processes for brine desalination. We then highlight the opportunity of HPRO to reduce energy requirements for desalination of key high-salinity industrial wastewaters. The current state of membrane materials and processes for hypersaline brine desalination is also discussed, emphasizing several process-design considerations unique to HPRO. Lastly, we discuss the most pressing research needs for the development of HPRO, notably the development of membranes and modules suitable for high pressures as well as fundamental studies of compaction and transport at HPRO conditions.},

abstract = {In this research, the pore formation mechanism of the membranes through the vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) technique is studied. Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membranes are successfully fabricated by a combination of the vapor-induce phase separation (VIPS) and non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS), known as VIPS-NIPS method, and the influence of exposure time is investigated on the characteristics of the fabricated membranes. The membranes are characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, porosity, maximum pore radius, pore size distribution (PSD), liquid entry pressure of water (LEPw), mechanical strength, and flux of ethanol through the membrane. The results demonstrated the pore radius of the membranes increased, then decreased, and then increased again by increasing the exposure time. The narrowest pore size distribution was obtained for the membranes when the polymeric film was exposed to the humid environment for five minutes. The pore size distribution results confirmed the four-step mechanism for pore formation in the VIPS process. The nucleation points are formed on the membrane surface in the VIPS step. At low exposure times, the number of nuclei is low and they grow in the coagulation bath and form large pores. By increasing the exposure time, the number of nuclei is increased and reaches a maximum value. At this point, the growth of nuclei in the coagulation bath is minimum and results in a membrane with a smaller pore radius. Afterward, by increasing the VIPS time, the nuclei become larger and join each other to make larger pores, therefore, a wider pore size distribution with a larger average pore radius of the membrane would be expected.}

Eighteen flat-sheet MCs are fabricated using polysulfone (PSf) and polyethersulfone (PES) polymers, with polymer concentration of 10%, 15%, and 20%. Dimethylformamide (DMF) and n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents are used to prepare the polymeric solutions. The role of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the mean pore size of MCs is also studied. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis is applied to visualize the pore system of the fabricated MCs. Image processing technique is used to obtain the PSD of the fabricated MCs using their SEM images. Experimental results indicate that increasing polymer concentration shifts the PSD of MCs toward smaller pores. Polymer concentration has negligible impact on the mean pore size of the NMP-based MCs. For the DMF-based MCs however, mean pore size significantly decreases by increasing polymer concentration. Also, NMP-based MCs have smaller pore size compared with the DMF-based MCs. Addition of PVP to the polymeric solutions lead to larger mean pores. This observation is very pronounced at low polymer concentration values.}

Membrane separation technology is one of the most cost-effective and widely applied technologies for water purification.

Although further development of polymeric membranes for better performance is laborious, the research findings and sustained progress in inorganic membrane development have grown fast and solve some remaining problems. In addition to conventional ceramic metal oxide membranes, membranes prepared by graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and mixed matrix materials (MMMs) have attracted enormous attention due to their desirable properties such as tunable pore structure, excellent chemical, mechanical, and thermal tolerance, good salt rejection and/or high water permeability. This review provides insight into synthesis approaches and structural properties of recent reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes which are used to retain dissolved species such as heavy metals, electrolytes, and inorganic salts in various aqueous solutions. A specific focus has been placed on introducing and comparing water purification performance of different classes of polymeric and ceramic membranes in related water treatment industries.

   abstract = {It was shown for the first time that the conditions of thermal treatment of the casting solution significantly affect the morphology and transport properties of porous, flat, and hollow fiber polysulfone (PSf) membranes. It is ascertained that the main solution components that are subjected to thermo-oxidative destruction are the pore-forming agent polyethylene glycol (PEG) and solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). It is proved that hydroxyl groups of PEG actively react in the process of the casting solution thermo-oxidative destruction. It is shown that despite the chemical conversion taking place in the casting solution, their stability towards coagulation virtually does not change. The differences in the membrane morphology associated with the increase of thermal treatment time at 120 °C are not connected to the thermodynamic properties of the casting solutions, but with the kinetics of the phase separation. It is revealed that the change of morphology and transport properties of membranes is connected with the increase of the casting solution viscosity. The rise of solution viscosity resulted in the slowdown of the phase separation and formation of a more densely packed membrane structure with less pronounced macropores. It is determined experimentally that with the increase of casting solution thermal treatment time, the membrane selective layer thickness increases. This leads to the decrease of gas permeance and the rise of the He/CO2 selectivity for flat and hollow fiber membranes. In the case of hollow fibers, the fall of gas permeance is also connected with the appearance of the sponge-like layer at the outer surface of membranes. The increase of selectivity and decline of permeance indicates the reduction of selective layer pore size and its densification, which agrees well with the calculation results of the average membrane density. The results obtained are relevant to any polymeric casting solution containing NMP and/or PEG and treated at temperatures above 60 °C.},

This temperature difference makes possible the coating of different commodity plastic materials (e.g., Nafion, polyethersulfone). These combustion synthesis conditions enable us to to spray coat uniform palladium films with moderate conductivity (1.1 × 105 S m−1) at 191 °C. Spray coating at 226 °C yields films with conductivities (2.0 × 106 S m−1) comparable to those of sputtered films (2.0 to 5.8 × 106 S m−1). This work shows how a self-driving laboratoy can discover materials that provide optimal trade-offs between conflicting objectives.},

Data in materials science are particularly heterogeneous, based on the significant range in materials classes that are explored and the variety of materials properties that are of interest. This leads to data that range many orders of magnitude, and these data may manifest as numerical text or image-based information, which requires quantitative interpretation. The ability to automatically consume and codify the scientific literature across domains - enabled by techniques adapted from the field of natural language processing - therefore has immense potential to unlock and generate the rich datasets necessary for data science and machine learning. This review focuses on the progress and practices of natural language processing and text mining of materials science literature and highlights opportunities for extracting additional information beyond text contained in figures and tables in articles. We discuss and provide examples for several reasons for the pursuit of natural language processing for materials, including data compilation, hypothesis development, and understanding the trends within and across fields. Current and emerging natural language processing methods along with their applications to materials science are detailed. We, then, discuss natural language processing and data challenges within the materials science domain where future directions may prove valuable.},

For novel polymers, it is often an arduous process to find the appropriate solvents for polymer dissolution. Heuristic approaches, such as solubility parameters, provide only limited guidance with respect to solvent prediction and design. The present work highlights a novel data-driven paradigm for solvent selection in polymers. For this purpose, we utilize a deep neural network trained on a massive data set of over 4500 polymers and their corresponding solvents/nonsolvents. This deep-learning framework maps high-dimensional fingerprints/features to compact chemically relevant latent space representations of solvents and polymers. When these low-dimensional representations are visualized, we observe the spontaneous clustering of nonpolar, polar-aprotic, and polar-protic behavior. This large-scale data-driven approach possesses an overall classification accuracy of above 93% (on a hold-out set) and significantly outperforms existing methods to determine polymer/solvent compatibility such as the Hildebrand criteria.},

A generative model is trained on ∼12 000 polymers manually collected from the largest existing polymer database PolyInfo, and then the model is used to generate ∼1 million polymers. A new representation for polymers, polymer embedding (PE), is introduced, which is then used to perform several polymer informatics regression tasks for density, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and dielectric constants. By comparing the PE trained by the PolyInfo data and that by the PI1M data, we conclude that the PI1M database covers similar chemical space as PolyInfo, but significantly populate regions where PolyInfo data are sparse.

As such, they contain free owing unstructured text. Given the usefulness of data extraction from unstructured literature, we aim to show how this can be achieved for the discipline of chemistry. The highly formulaic style of writing most chemists adopt make their contributions well suited to high-throughput Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches. Results: We have developed the ChemicalTagger parser as a medium-depth, phrase-based semantic NLP tool for the language of chemical experiments. Tagging is based on a modular architecture and uses a combination of OSCAR, domain-specific regex and English taggers to identify parts-of-speech. The ANTLR grammar is used to structure this into tree-based phrases. Using a metric that allows for overlapping annotations, we achieved machine-annotator agreements of 88.9% for phrase recognition and 91.9% for phrase-type identification (Action names). Conclusions: It is possible parse to chemical experimental text using rule-based techniques in conjunction with a formal grammar parser. ChemicalTagger has been deployed for over 10,000 patents and has identified solvents from their linguistic context with >99.5% precision. © 2011 Hawizy et al; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.},

Performance benchmark results show that Mordred is at least twice as fast as the well-known PaDEL-Descriptor and it can calculate descriptors for large molecules, which cannot be accomplished by other software. Owing to its good performance, convenience, number of descriptors, and a lax licensing constraint, Mordred is a promising choice of molecular descriptor calculation software that can be utilized for cheminformatics studies, such as those on quantitative structure-property relationships.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

   abstract = {Background. A method to estimate ease of synthesis (synthetic accessibility) of drug-like molecules is needed in many areas of the drug discovery process. The development and validation of such a method that is able to characterize molecule synthetic accessibility as a score between 1 (easy to make) and 10 (very difficult to make) is described in this article. Results. The method for estimation of the synthetic accessibility score (SAscore) described here is based on a combination of fragment contributions and a complexity penalty. Fragment contributions have been calculated based on the analysis of one million representative molecules from PubChem and therefore one can say that they capture historical synthetic knowledge stored in this database. The molecular complexity score takes into account the presence of non-standard structural features, such as large rings, non-standard ring fusions, stereocomplexity and molecule size. The method has been validated by comparing calculated SAscores with ease of synthesis as estimated by experienced medicinal chemists for a set of 40 molecules. The agreement between calculated and manually estimated synthetic accessibility is very good with r2 = 0.89. Conclusion. A novel method to estimate synthetic accessibility of molecules has been developed. This method uses historical synthetic knowledge obtained by analyzing information from millions of already synthesized chemicals and considers also molecule complexity. The method is sufficiently fast and provides results consistent with estimation of ease of synthesis by experienced medicinal chemists. The calculated SAscore may be used to support various drug discovery processes where a large number of molecules needs to be ranked based on their synthetic accessibility, for example when purchasing samples for screening, selecting hits from high-throughput screening for follow-up, or ranking molecules generated by various de novo design approaches. © 2009 Ertl and Schuffenhauer; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Here, we present a simple sequence-to-sequence approach to joint named entity recognition and relation extraction for complex hierarchical information in scientific text. The approach leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM), GPT-3, that is fine-tuned on approximately 500 pairs of prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs). Information is extracted either from single sentences or across sentences in abstracts/passages, and the output can be returned as simple English sentences or a more structured format, such as a list of JSON objects. We demonstrate that LLMs trained in this way are capable of accurately extracting useful records of complex scientific knowledge for three representative tasks in materials chemistry: linking dopants with their host materials, cataloging metal-organic frameworks, and general chemistry/phase/morphology/application information extraction. This approach represents a simple, accessible, and highly-flexible route to obtaining large databases of structured knowledge extracted from unstructured text.

It was found that the cell morphology in MNL structures is governed by the synergy of two categories of parameter: morphological parameters, i.e., layer thicknesses and the number of layer interfaces, and material parameters, i.e., material stiffness and compatibility. The presence of adjacent film layers can significantly increase cell density through two mechanisms: promoting heterogeneous cell nucleation and preventing cell deterioration. The influence of film layers varied in different layer thickness regions and interface densities, where stiffer and more compatible film layers produced higher cell densities by further enhancing these two mechanisms. Moreover, as a stiffness-enhancing strategy, the crystallization of the Polycarbonate was successfully achieved in MNL structures in a high-pressure CO2 environment for the first time, resulting in more pronounced optimization of cell morphology.},

   abstract = {Significant slip can occur in the flow of a blend of two immiscible polymers due to reduced entanglements at their interface. The slip is of practical importance because of its effect on morphology and adhesion in, for example, disordered two-phase blends or multilayer films. Interfacial slip was quantified using two polymer pairs each with closely matched viscosity and elasticity but different miscibility (): polypropylene (PP)/polystyrene (PS) =0.04 and polyethylene (PE)/fluoropolymer (FP) 0.1. To control the amount of interfacial area, we prepared alternating layers by coextrusion. The number of layers of PP/PS ranged from 20 to 640 while that for PE/FP was 80. Nominal viscosity of the multilayer samples was measured with three types of rheometers: an in-line slit-die rheometer, rotational parallel-disks, and sliding plate. Good agreement was found between the three methods. The nominal viscosity as well as shear normal stresses of the multilayer samples decreased with the number of layers. From the viscosity reduction, an apparent interfacial slip velocity Vslip was calculated. The detectable slip, about 1 μm/s, occurred at the same level of stress normalized by average plateau modulus τ/ G N,av 0 =0.01 for both pairs. However, Vslip did not show a sudden increase at a critical shear stress as predicted by Brochard-Wyart and de Gennes [C. R. Acad. Sci., Ser. II: Mec., Phys., Chim., Sci. Terre Univers 317, 13 (1993)] but rather increased Vslip τ n, where n≈3 for PS/PP and n≈6 for PE/FP. The steeper dependence of slip on stress for PE/FP may be related to its higher value and with its narrower molecular weight distribution. © 2009 The Society of Rheology.},

Incorporation of long-chain branches is a common approach to increase melt strength; however, it is a costly process. To bridge this gap, we set out to study the effect of ionic content on the foaming behavior of linear PP ionomers using a PP homopolymer as a control and a commercial high melt strength long-chain branched PP as a benchmark. Small-angle X-ray scattering confirms the presence of ion clusters in the ionomers, which act as physical cross-linking points as was recently shown, providing enhancement to the dynamic moduli, complex viscosity, and strain hardening behavior, even at ion contents below 0.1 mol %. We found that, upon foaming, the PP ionomer with a higher ionic content exhibited higher foam uniformity, higher cell density (∼108cells/cm3), and smaller cell size (as small as 37 μm) compared to those of its linear counterpart. Furthermore, the linear ionomer resin and the commercial branched PP showed similar foam morphologies and mechanical responses under cyclic indentations over the temperature range 155-175 °C. These findings reveal a new, and potentially cost-effective, route to produce high performance foams using linear PPs that are compliant to industrial standards.},

Our results show that models published before 2022 show virtually no ability to solve ToM tasks. Yet, the January 2022 version of GPT-3 (davinci-002) solved 70% of ToM tasks, a performance comparable with that of seven-year-old children.

   abstract = { This article surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub “prompt-based learning.” Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input  x  and predict an output  y  as P (  y|x  ), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input  x  is modified using a template into a textual string prompt  x′  that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string  x̂  , from which the final output  y  can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g., the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other resources, e.g., a website NLPedia–Pretrain including constantly updated survey and paperlist. },

   abstract = {Deep learning algorithms trained to predict masked words from large amount of text have recently been shown to generate activations similar to those of the human brain. However, what drives this similarity remains currently unknown. Here, we systematically compare a variety of deep language models to identify the computational principles that lead them to generate brain-like representations of sentences. Specifically, we analyze the brain responses to 400 isolated sentences in a large cohort of 102 subjects, each recorded for two hours with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We then test where and when each of these algorithms maps onto the brain responses. Finally, we estimate how the architecture, training, and performance of these models independently account for the generation of brain-like representations. Our analyses reveal two main findings. First, the similarity between the algorithms and the brain primarily depends on their ability to predict words from context. Second, this similarity reveals the rise and maintenance of perceptual, lexical, and compositional representations within each cortical region. Overall, this study shows that modern language algorithms partially converge towards brain-like solutions, and thus delineates a promising path to unravel the foundations of natural language processing.},

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

   abstract = {It is commonly believed that the overall permeation resistance of thin film composite (TFC) membranes is dictated by the crosslinked, ultrathin polyamide barrier layer, while the porous support merely serves as the mechanical support. Although this assumption might be the case under low transmembrane pressure, it becomes questionable under high transmembrane pressure. A highly porous support normally yields under a pressure of a few MPa, which can result in a significant level of compressive strain that may significantly increase the resistance to permeation. However, quantifying the influence of porous support deformation on the overall resistance of the TFC membrane is challenging. In particular, it is difficult to determine the deformation/strain of the membrane during active separation. In this study, we use nanoimprint lithography (NIL) to achieve precise compressive deformation in commercial TFC membranes. By adjusting the NIL conditions, membranes were compressed to strain levels up to 60%. SEM and AFM measurements showed that the compression had minimal impact on the barrier-layer surface morphology and total surface area with most of the deformation occurring in the support layer. DI water permeation measurements revealed that the water flux reduction decreases with an increase of strain level. Most significantly, the intrinsic membrane resistance showed negligible changes at strain levels lower than 30%–40%, but increased exponentially at higher strain levels, reaching 250%–500% of pristine (unstrained) membrane values. Using a resistance-in-series model, the strain dependency of the TFC membrane resistance can be described.},

However, the deformation mechanism underlying membrane surface-patterning with nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is currently unclear. In response to this need, this study addresses the influence of nanoimprinting on the structural and performance characteristics of a commercial polyethersulfone (PES) UF membrane. The work utilized a flat (no pattern) as well as a pattern-containing mold such that local surface deformation associated with pattern formation could be isolated from the overall mechanical deformation in compression. The mechanical properties of the UF membrane as a function of temperature and deformation rate were characterized, and the overall thickness, molecular weight cutoff, and DI water permeance were measured for membranes imprinted using the flat mold. The data show that the influence of the NIL process on the membrane structure is length-scale dependent. Furthermore, imprinting of the UF membrane with the pattern-containing mold was examined experimentally as well as with finite element simulation. Results indicate that the non-uniform contact deformation at the membrane-mold interface provides the potential to optimize the NIL conditions for achieving desired pattern geometries without significantly increasing the membrane resistance.},

   abstract = {Most polymeric membranes are engineered to have high porosity in order to reduce transport resistance of the permeate(s). However, since most polymers are relatively compliant and exhibit time-dependent behavior, such membranes are prone to deformation under mechanical loading that can occur during different stages of manufacturing as well as during separation. Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand the influence of mechanical deformation on the permeability of the membranes. However, an appropriate relationship has not been established due to the lack of methods that can precisely control membrane deformation and the significant variability of membrane properties. Here, we report the systematic and quantitative examination of the permeability-deformation relationship for microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with different pore structure and chemistry. Polymer membranes were deformed to different levels of compressive strain using nanoimprint lithography with systematically different processing conditions. Furthermore, permeation measurements were carried out on each membrane sample before and after the compressive deformation to minimize membrane variability concerns. The experimental results reveal that the permeability of the MF and UF membranes decreases with the increase of compressive strain such that the dependency approaches the behavior of an open-cell foam. The derived relationship is simple but useful despite key differences between open-cell foams and porous membranes including pore structure asymmetry and the much smaller pore size of the latter.},

   abstract = {The thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) method is regaining momentum as a competitive platform to fabricate highly porous microporous membranes. In membrane technology, there has been an active search for more sustainable ways to fabricate polymeric membranes using green solvents. Rhodiasolv PolarClean® is a recently identified environmentally friendly TIPS solvent that shows high potential for the preparation of microporous PVDF membranes. Interestingly, its high miscibility with water induces a nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) effect on the membrane surface and this simultaneous NIPS-TIPS effect is referred to as the combined NIPS-TIPS (N-TIPS) method. In this work, a thorough investigation was carried out to understand the underlying phenomena in the membrane formation kinetics during the N-TIPS process. It was found that the NIPS and TIPS morphology can be tailored to control the mechanical properties, pore size distribution, and flux of the prepared membranes. For instance, increasing the coagulation bath solvent concentration facilitated the formation of a spherulitic morphology, whereas increasing the bath temperature induced the formation of a bicontinuous morphology free of macrovoids. It was determined that by controlling the phase separation kinetics, the mechanical properties of the prepared PVDF membranes could be remarkably improved from 0.9 MPa to 6.1 MPa. Several pore-forming additives including polyvinylpyrrolidone, Pluronics F-127, LiCl, and glycerol were employed to induce surface pores and their effects were thoroughly characterized. The membranes prepared with Pluronic additives exhibited high water permeabilities up to 2800 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 with narrow pore size distributions.},

The establishment of desalination plants, particularly those using membrane technology, has been one such solution. There are three primary categories of desalination: Evaporation and Condensation, Filtration, and Crystallization. Additionally, desalination can be classified by the kind of energy used: Thermal, Mechanical, Electrical, and Chemical energy. Reverse osmosis (RO) is a globally sophisticated known tech, accounting for about 70 % of global desalination usage. This effort is built to summarize RO preceded studies, focusing on membrane modules and design processes, operational problems, and saline removal efficiency. The RO system is based on using osmotic pressure imposing water in the membrane in a way lessens energy compared to other desalination systems. The efficiency of RO depends on feed water properties, operating parameters, and membrane characteristics. Despite its success, RO technology faces challenges such as fouling (colloidal, organic, and biofouling) and scaling, which result from high concentrations of salts and pollutants in the feed water. Scaling can increase energy consumption, reduce membrane lifespan, and decrease desalination yield. Continuous cleaning is required when fouling occurs, with both chemical and physical cleaning methods being employed. This study also offers numerous suggestions for future research.}

We demonstrate how mass-transfer-induced spinodal decomposition, thermal fluctuations, and glass-transition dynamics - implemented with mobility contrast between the polymer-rich and polymer-poor phases - are essential to the formation of asymmetric membrane microstructures.

   abstract = {In recent years, numerous large-scale seawater desalination plants have been built in water-stressed countries to augment available water resources, and construction of new desalination plants is expected to increase in the near future. Despite major advancements in desalination technologies, seawater desalination is still more energy intensive compared to conventional technologies for the treatment of fresh water. There are also concerns about the potential environmental impacts of large-scale seawater desalination plants. Here, we review the possible reductions in energy demand by state-of-the-art seawater desalination technologies, the potential role of advanced materials and innovative technologies in improving performance, and the sustainability of desalination as a technological solution to global water shortages. W ater scarcity is one of the most serious global challenges of our time. Presently , over one-third of the world's population lives in water-stressed countries and by 2025, this figure is predicted to rise to nearly two-thirds (1). The challenge of providing ample and safe drinking water is further complicated by population growth, industrialization, contamination of available freshwater resources, and climate change. At the same time, greater recognition of the broad societal and ecological benefits that stem from adequate water resources-economic vitality, public health, national security, and ecosystem health-is motivating the search for technological solutions to water shortages. Several measures to alleviate the stresses on water supply should be implemented, including water conservation, repair of infrastructure, and improved catchment and distribution systems. However, while these measures are important, they can only improve the use of existing water resources, not increase them. The only methods to increase water supply beyond what is available from the hydrological cycle are desalination and water reuse (2). Of these, seawater desalination offers a seemingly unlimited, steady supply of high-quality water, without impairing natural freshwater ecosystems. Desalination of brackish groundwaters is also an option to augment water supply for inland regions; however, the management of brines from inland desalination plants is a major challenge because these plants are placed far from the coast. There has been rapid growth in the installation of seawater desalination facilities in the past decade as a means to augment water supply in water-stressed countries (1, 3, 4). Notable examples are the large-scale seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants recently constructed in Spain (5) and Israel (6, 7). In 2016, the global water production by desalination is projected to exceed 38 billion m 3 per year, twice the rate of global water production by desalination in 2008 (3). Early large-scale desalination plants, mostly in the arid Gulf countries, were based on thermal desalination, where the seawater is heated and the evaporated water is condensed to produce fresh water (8). Such plants, still in operation in the Gulf countries, consume substantial amounts of thermal and electric energy, which result in a large emission of greenhouse gases (9). Excluding those in the Gulf countries, the vast majority of desalination plants constructed in the past two decades, as well as future planned facilities, are based on reverse osmosis technology (Fig. 1), where seawater is pressurized against a semi-permeable membrane that lets water pass through but retains salt (4). Reverse osmosis technology has improved considerably in the past two decades, and current desalination plants can desalinate seawater with much less energy than thermal desalination (4, 9). At present, reverse osmosis is the most energy-efficient technology for seawater desalination and is the benchmark for comparison for any new desalination technology. In this review, we assess the energy efficiency , the state of the technology, and the environmental challenges of seawater desalination. We highlight the main open questions, how future studies might address them, and what new approaches are needed to advance the science and technology of seawater desalination. What Is the Current Energy Efficiency of Desalination and Can It Be Improved? The amount of power needed to drive desalination in SWRO plants has declined dramatically in the past 40 years (Fig. 2A) (4, 8, 10, 11). This decrease in energy consumption is attributed to continual technological improvements, including higher-permeability membranes, installation of energy recovery devices, and the use of more efficient pumps (4).

Since separation occurs due to a gas-liquid phase change, near-complete rejection of dissolved solutes including sodium chloride, boron, urea, and N-nitrosodimethyl-amine is observed. Membranes fabricated with sub-200-nm-thick air layers showed water permeabilities that exceed those of commercial membranes without sacrificing salt rejection.

For different concentrations ranging from 20,000 ppm to 33,000 ppm, the influence of increasing brine recirculation rate and compressor speed were observed. It has been found that the performance is better with lower concentration and increased compressor speed. The highest average PR obtained was 2.52. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Despite water scarcity, the use of industrial waste heat for seawater desalination has been limited in the Middle East to date. This study evaluates the technical and economic feasibility of integrating on-site gas turbine power generation and reverse osmosis equipment for the production of both electricity and fresh water in a coastal hydrocarbon production facility. Gas turbine exhaust gas waste heat is recovered using an intermediate heat transfer fluid and fed to an organic Rankine cycle evaporator, to generate mechanical power to drive the reverse osmosis high pressure pump. Six candidate organic working fluids are evaluated, namely toluene, benzene, cyclohexane, cyclopentane, n-pentane and R245fa. Thermodynamic and desalination performance are assessed in the harsh climatic and salinity conditions of the Arabian Gulf. The performance metrics considered incorporate electric power and permeate production, thermal and exergy efficiency, specific energy consumption, system size, and permeate quality. Using toluene in the bottoming power cycle, a gain in power generation efficiency of approximately 12% is achieved relative to the existing gas turbine cycle, with an annual average of 2260 m3/h of fresh water produced. Depending upon the projected evolution of local water prices, the investment becomes profitable after two to four years, with an end-of-life net present value of 220-380 million USD, and internal rate of return of 26-48%.},

   abstract = {Water scarcity is a grand challenge that has always stimulated research interests in finding effective means for pure water production. In this context, reverse osmosis (RO) is considered the leading and the most optimized membrane-based desalination process that is currently dominating the desalination market. In this review, various aspects of RO desalination are reviewed. Theories and models related to concentration polarization and membrane transport, as well as merits and drawbacks of these models in predicting polarization effects, are discussed. An updated review of studies related to membrane modules (plate and frame, tubular, spiral wound, and hollow fiber) and membrane characterization are provided. The review also discusses membrane cleaning and different pre-treatment technologies in place for RO desalination, such as feed-water pre-treatment and biocides. RO pre-treatment technologies, which include conventional (e.g., coagulation-flocculation, media filtration, disinfection, scale inhibition) and non-conventional (e.g., MF, UF, and NF) are reviewed and their relative attributes are compared. As per the available literature, UF, MF and coagulation-flocculation are considered the most widely used pre-treatment technologies. In addition, this review discusses membrane fouling, which represents a serious challenge in RO processes due to its significant contribution to energy requirements and process economy (e.g., flux decline, permeate quality, membrane lifespan, increased feed pressure, increased pre-treatment and membrane maintenance cost). Different membrane fouling types, such as colloidal, organic, inorganic, and biological fouling, are addressed in this review. Principles of RO process design and the embedded economic and energy considerations are discussed. In general, cost of water desalination has dropped to values that made it a viable option, comparable even to conventional water treatment methods. Finally, an overview of hybrid RO desalination processes and the current challenges faced by RO desalination processes are presented and discussed.},

Membrane separation technology is one of the most cost-effective and widely applied technologies for water purification. Polymeric membranes such as cellulose-based (CA) membranes and thin-film composite (TFC) membranes have dominated the industry since 1980.

In addition to conventional ceramic metal oxide membranes, membranes prepared by graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and mixed matrix materials (MMMs) have attracted enormous attention due to their desirable properties such as tunable pore structure, excellent chemical, mechanical, and thermal tolerance, good salt rejection and/or high water permeability. This review provides insight into synthesis approaches and structural properties of recent reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes which are used to retain dissolved species such as heavy metals, electrolytes, and inorganic salts in various aqueous solutions. A specific focus has been placed on introducing and comparing water purification performance of different classes of polymeric and ceramic membranes in related water treatment industries.

First, temperature-responsive PNIPAAm hydrogel was prepared by reactive pore-filling to adjust the pore size of non-woven fabric, creating hydrophilic support. The developed PET-based support was then used to fabricate PA TFC membranes via interfacial polymerization. SEM–EDX and AFM results confirmed the successful fabrication of hydrogel-integrated non-woven fabric and PA TFC membranes. The newly developed PA TFC membrane demonstrated an average water permeability of 1 L/m2 h bar, and an NaCl rejection of 47.0% at a low operating pressure of 1 bar. The thermo-responsive property of the prepared membrane was studied by measuring the water contact angle (WCA) below and above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the PNIPAAm hydrogel. Results proved the thermo-responsive behavior of the prepared hydrogel-filled PET-supported PA TFC membrane and the ability to tune the membrane flux by changing the operating temperature was confirmed. Overall, this study provides a novel method to fabricate TFC membranes and helps to better understand the influence of the support layer on the separation performance of TFC membranes.},

The current market of RO membranes is focused on thin-film composite polyamide membranes, which are made of three layers and with an average molecular weight cut-off of 100–150 Da in order to obtain a high salt rejection. Until reaching current RO membranes, there have been numerous developments, highlighting the development of NS-100 membranes by Cadotte in 1977 and subsequent optimization of the manufacturing conditions. Other improvements were surface modification and membrane post-treatment actions. The most common configuration used in desalination plants are polyamide spiral wound membranes (SWM), which involves several flat sheet membranes that are glued together pairwise on three sides with the fourth side left open. The membrane elements are connected in series using interconnectors and installed into a pressure vessel. Current research regarding SWM is focused on providing greater surface area within the same volume. Another point of interest is to achieve a high retention of boron to comply with current legislation.}

In the past 30 years, different approaches have been exploited to produce the TFC membrane with high water flux, excellent salt rejection, and better chlorine/fouling resistance. In this brief review, we classify the techniques that have been utilized to improve the RO-TFC membrane properties into four categories: (1) Using alternative monomers to prepare the active layer; (2) modification of membrane surface; (3) optimization of polymerization reactions; and (4) incorporation of nanoparticles (NPs) into the membrane PA layer.

But some challenges remain for several methods used for membrane fabrication, suggesting the need for a critical review of the literature. We present here an overview on porous polymeric membrane preparation and characterization for two commonly used polymers: polysulfone and poly (vinylidene fluoride). Five different methods for membrane fabrication are introduced: non-solvent induced phase separation, vapor-induced phase separation, electrospinning, track etching and sintering. The key factors of each method are discussed, including the solvent and non-solvent system type and composition, the polymer solution composition and concentration, the processing parameters, and the ambient conditions. To evaluate these methods, a brief description on membrane characterization is given related to morphology and performance. One objective of this review is to present the basics for selecting an appropriate method and membrane fabrication systems with appropriate processing conditions to produce membranes with the desired morphology, performance and stability, as well as to select the best methods to determine these properties.},

abstract = {Aromatic polyamide asymmetric “skin type” membranes have been prepared by the Loeb-Sourirajan technique. Two different structures were obtained, depending on the rate of precipitation. Low precipitation rates produced membranes with sponge-like structures. These membranes usually had high salt rejections and low water fluxes. High precipitation rates produced membranes with large finger-like pores. These membranes had low salt rejections and high water fluxes. Possible mechanisms producing these two structures are discussed. It is proposed that high concentrations of polymer in the casting solution, and hence high viscosities at the point of precipitation, or a thick viscous sublayer in advance of the precipitating polymer front both favour sponge-structured membrane formation. The suggested mechanisms are supported by data showing the effect of various preparation parameters such as polymer concentration and casting solution and precipitation bath composition on membrane structure.}

The influences of membrane fabrication parameters including coagulation bath temperature, relative humidity, pre-evaporation time and membrane thickness on PSf membrane properties were systematically explored. The sponge-like-structured PSf membranes were formed while the coagulation bath temperature, relative humidity, pre-evaporation time and membrane thickness were 60 °C, 20%, 30 s, and 60 μm, respectively. Additionally, three types of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) non-woven fabrics (NWFs) with different properties were selected to study the influencing mechanism on PSf membrane with sponge-like structure. It was found that the PSf membrane (PSf-NWF-01) formed on more hydrophilic PET NWFs exhibited higher porosity (63%) and excellent performances (with a pure water flux of 463.69 L/(m2·h) and the BSA rejection of 97.58%), which was caused by a higher adhesion existed between more hydrophilic NWF surface and PSf casting solution. Moreover, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane also exhibited the highest flux recovery ratio of 88.59% and the lowest irreversible fouling of 11.41%. This work academically clarified the influence mechanism of PET NWFs properties on spongy-like PSf membranes, which also had theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate PET NWFs for the preparation of PSf membranes in industry.},

Thereafter, water at a fixed transmembrane pressure has been filtered and the flux as a function of compaction has been measured. For comparison, membranes have also been compressed hydrostatically, that is with water passing constantly through the membranes at different pressures. At corresponding pressures, the mechanical treatment lowered the flux much more than did the hydrostatic treatment. Cellulose acetate membranes displayed more elastic than viscous behaviour, polysulfone membranes the contrary. The flux was never restored after compaction, and the flux reduction increased with increasing precompression pressure. The glass transition temperature did not seem to have any influence on the compressibility in the present temperature range, but the porosity and the membrane structure were important. The membranes' thickness change could be correlated to the applied pressure as A l ~ A pO.s, a relation typical for porous materials.},

Methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate (Rhodiasolv PolarClean) is a bio-derived, biodegradable, nonflammable and nonvolatile solvent. Polysulfone is a commonly used polymer to fabricate membranes due to its thermal stability, strong mechanical strength and good chemical resistance. From cloud point curves, PolarClean showed potential to be a solvent for polysulfone. Membranes prepared with PolarClean were investigated in terms of their morphology, porosity, water permeability and protein rejection, and were compared to membranes prepared with traditional solvents. The pores of polysulfone/PolarClean membranes were sponge-like, and the membranes displayed higher water flux values (176.0 ± 8.8 LMH) along with slightly higher solute rejection (99.0 ± 0.51%). On the other hand, PSf/DMAc membrane pores were finger-like with lower water flux (63.1 ± 12.4 LMH) and slightly lower solute rejection (96 ± 2.00%) when compared to PSf/PolarClean membranes.},

ABSTRACT = {(1) Different methods have been applied to fabricate polymeric membranes with non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) being one of the mostly widely used. In NIPS, a solvent or solvent blend is required to dissolve a polymer or polymer blend. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), dimethylformamide (DMF) and other petroleum-derived solvents are commonly used to dissolve some petroleum-based polymers. However, these components may have negative impacts on the environment and human health. Therefore, using greener and less toxic components is of great interest for increasing membrane fabrication sustainability. The chemical structure of membranes is not affected by the use of different solvents, polymers, or by the differences in fabrication scale. On the other hand, membrane pore structures and surface roughness can change due to differences in diffusion rates associated with different solvents/co-solvents diffusing into the non-solvent and with differences in evaporation time. (2) Therefore, in this review, solvents and polymers involved in the manufacturing process of membranes are proposed to be replaced by greener/less toxic alternatives. The methods and feasibility of scaling up green polymeric membrane manufacturing are also examined.},

   abstract = {Nonsolvent induced phase separation has been widely used to fabricate polymeric membranes. Common solvents, such as dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), are toxic and not environmentally friendly; therefore, eco-friendly alternatives are needed. Eco-friendly solvents, such as Rhodiasolv® PolarClean (PolarClean) and γ-valerolactone (GVL), have been investigated to replace DMAc and NMP at the laboratory scale; however, not extensively at the production scale. In this work, the feasibility of fabricating polysulfone (PSf) ultrafiltration membranes using eco-friendly solvents at laboratory and production scales is investigated. First, it was determined that the addition of GVL to dope solutions of PolarClean could reduce the original preparation time at a rotation speed of 450 RPM by two-thirds, and by three-quarters at 600 RPM. Furthermore, dope solutions exhibit Newtonian fluid behavior. Doctor blade extrusion and a roll-to-roll (R2R) system integrated with slot die casting are used to fabricate the PSf ultrafiltration membranes at laboratory and production scales, respectively, and the resulting membranes are compared structurally, morphologically and operationally. The chemical structure of membranes is not affected by the use of different solvents or by the differences in fabrication scale. On the other hand, cross-sectional images show that the structures of the membranes are different, most likely due to differences in diffusion rates between the different solvents/co-solvents into the nonsolvent, water. Furthermore, it has been observed that the roughness values of the membranes relative to the fabrication process is different, possibly due to differences in the required evaporation time. All membranes display similar operational parameters, i.e., flux decline, permeability and recovery, during bovine serum albumin (BSA) filtration. Therefore, this study shows that PSf membranes fabricated using eco-friendly solvent mixtures are comparable to traditional membranes, cast using petroleum-derived solvents, and are scalable using slot die casting on a R2R.},

   abstract = {Batik wastewater, in general, is colored and has high concentrations of BOD (biological oxygen demand), COD (chemical oxygen demand), and dissolved and suspended solids. Polysulfone (PSf)-based membranes with the addition of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) were prepared to treat batik industrial wastewater. PSf/PVP membranes were prepared using the phase inversion method with Nmethyl- 2 pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent. Based on the membrane characterization through FESEM, water contact angle, porosity, and mechanical tests showed a phenomenon where the addition of PVP provided thermodynamic and kinetic effects on membrane formation, thereby affecting porosity, thickness, and hydrophilicity of the membranes. The study aims to observe the effect of adding PVP on polysulfone membrane permeability and antifouling performance on a laboratory scale through the ultrafiltration (UF) process. With the addition of PVP, the operational pressure of the polysulfone membrane was reduced compared to that without PVP. Based on the membrane filtration results, the highest removal efficiencies of COD, TDS (total dissolved solid), and conductivity achieved in the study were 80.4, 84.6, and 83.6%, respectively, on the PSf/PVP 0.35 membrane operated at 4 bar. Moreover, the highest color removal efficiency was 85.73% on the PSf/PVP 0.25 operated at 5 bar. The antifouling performance was identified by calculating the value of total, reversible, and irreversible membrane fouling, wherein in this study, the membrane with the best antifouling performance was PSf/PVP 0.25.},

Preparation techniques for polymer membranes show an important aspect of membrane properties. Generally, polysulfone (PSf) and polyethersulfone (PES) are used for the preparation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. Polysulfone (PSf) membranes have been widely used for separation and purification of different solutions because of their excellent chemical and thermal stability. Polymeric membranes were obtained by phase inversion method. The polymer solution introduced in the nonsolvent bath (distilled water) initiate the evaporation of the solvent from the solution, this phenomenon has a strong influence on the transport properties. The effect of the coagulation bath temperature on the membrane properties is of interest for this study. Membranes are characterized by pure water flux, permeability, porosity and retention of methylene blue. The low temperature of coagulation bath improve the membrane's rejection and its influence was most notable.},

   abstract = {Environmental sustainability requires development of environmentally benign and energy efficient technology for treatment and disposal of wastewater. Membrane technology has emerged as a highly viable method for water treatment throughout the years. However, their limited commercial application has prompted a lot of researchers to explore different approaches to modify the membranes to enhance their performance. Polymer blending is one of the modifying techniques currently being explored to develop materials with unique anticipated properties depending on the type of membrane needed. This technique has shown improvement in the quality of the membrane by enhancing the mechanical strength as well as the performance of the membrane. In this study, blended polysulfone (PSF) and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes were synthesized at different PSF:PES ratios (100%:0%, 0%:100%, 50%:50%, 80%:20%, 20%:80% and 25%:75%) using N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent via the phase inversion method. The quality and integrity of the membranes were checked via Scanning electron microscopy (for morphology); Thermogravimetric analysis (for thermal stability), Atomic force microscopy (for surface nature) and nanotensile measurement for mechanical strength. The flux, % rejection and porosity as the performance criteria of membranes showed a massive improvement in majority of the blended membranes than in pure PES and PSF membranes. AFM images indicated lower roughness in the pure PSF membrane as compared to the blended membranes. The tensile strength only improved on the 25%:75% membrane while the elasticity increased with an increase in PES concentration in the blended membranes. These results demonstrate the diversity of blending polymeric membranes to modify specific properties for desired function and highlight the possibility of more commercial application.},

Membrane filtration technologies have been widely applied in drinking water purification due to their energy efficiency while facing challenges like fouling, degradation and trade-offs, such as selectivity and permeability. The sustainable development of our society demands further understanding and improvement of those membranes. In this review, the basic structures of polymer-based water purification membranes including the effective layer for separation, the support layer and the possible top protective layer are presented. Details include the conventional membranes for microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF), the effective layers for separation in thin-film composite (TFC) membranes, electrospun nanofibrous membranes for MF, UF, and membrane distillation (MD), as well as the emerging self-assembled block copolymer membranes. Furthermore, the conventional support layers and electrospun nanofibrous support layers for reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) processes, and the top protective layers are discussed. The materials, membrane structures and properties, modification strategies, possible interlayers, interconnects, interpenetration, and interactions between different layers are discussed, with the emphasis on the cost-effectiveness of various membranes.},

Flat-sheet polyethersulfone (PES) membranes were prepared by wet phase inversion. The variables of interest were: the concentration of base polymer in the casting solution (dope solution), the solvent evaporation time, the addition of surface modifying macromolecules (SMMs), and the use of the additive polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The membranes were characterized by solute transport and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). No appreciable difference between the structures of surface–modified and unmodified membranes was observed by SEM. Membranes prepared with PVP had pure water permeation rates (PWP) significantly higher than membranes prepared without the PVP additive. However, the average polyethylene glycol (PEG 35ku (35kDa)) separation by membranes with PVP was approximately 15% lower than the tightest membranes prepared without PVP. The effect of surface modification with fluorinated additives and solvent evaporation time was observed only with high molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes prepared with 12wt.% PES casting solution.}

   abstract = {The polymeric based membrane technology has been an attractive alternative option among other gas separation technologies due to its ease of operation, good efficiency and low operational cost. However, a few concerns have been expressed about the polymeric based membrane technology for GS applications, such as the permeability-selectivity trade-off, mechanical stability and its environmental impacts. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of polymer concentration on a biopolymer-PVA asymmetric membrane morphology, its mechanical properties and gas transport behaviour in order to optimize it for O2/N2 separation using the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique. For this purpose, initially, a theoretical solubility model and cloud point phase diagram analysis were conducted to study the solubility and demixing behaviour of the PVA/Water/THF ternary system. Afterwards, these membranes were prepared at different polymeric concentrations from 10 to 14 weight percent (wt.%) and then characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), porosity measurement test, universal testing machine (UTM) and gas permeation test to analyse their physical structure, mechanical properties and GS performance. The analysis results showed that a lower polymer concentration of 10 wt.% facilitated larger pore sizes of 2.486 ± 1.2 μm with a higher porosity of 77.73 ± 15.26% having higher O2 permeance but lower O2/N2 selectivity and mechanical properties. Whereas, a higher polymer concentration of 12 wt.% promoted smaller pore sizes of 2.096 ± 0.5 μm with a porosity of 56.31 ± 3.6%, having better O2/N2 separation performance and higher mechanical properties. However, increasing the polymeric concentration to 14 wt.% resulted in a densified membrane structure having voids and small pore sizes of 1.447 ± 0.9 μm, with a porosity of 31.35 ± 11.98%, and lower elasticity causing membrane rigidified, making it unsuitable for GS applications. Therefore, the intermediate concentration of 12 wt.% PVA asymmetric membrane represents the most optimum morphology and mechanical properties for better O2/N2 separation.},

   abstract = {Here we report on the impacts of organic solvent properties, reaction conditions, and curing conditions on polyamide composite reverse osmosis membrane separation performance, film structure, and interfacial properties. We provide direct experimental evidence that: (1) MPD diffusivity in the organic phase governs MPD-TMC thin film water permeability, (2) MPD diffusivity and solubility influence MPD-TMC thin film crosslinking in competing ways, (3) water permeability correlates most strongly with MPD-TMC film structure (i.e., crosslinking), and (4) salt rejection correlates most strongly with MPD-TMC film thickness and morphology. Overall, higher flux membranes with good salt rejection appear to comprise thinner, more heavily crosslinked film structures. Such high performance RO membranes are obtained by (1) selecting high surface tension, low viscosity solvents, (2) controlling protonation of MPD and hydrolysis of TMC during interfacial polymerization, and (3) optimizing curing temperature and time based on organic solvent volatility. Finally, although more research is necessary, our results suggest the rugose morphology and relative hydrophobicity of high performance MPD-TMC membranes might enhance concentration polarization and exacerbate surface fouling. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The kinetic effect of the phase inversion process on the membrane morphology is explored, with emphasis on the diffusion coefficient of the nonsolvent as a measure of the solvent/nonsolvent exchange rate. The diffusion coefficient is closely related to the nonsolvent tolerance of the polymer solution, which was estimated from a pseudo-ternary phase diagram of the following system: polymer: polysulfone; solvent system: a mixture of the solvent l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and a solvent additive (formic acid, water or ethanol); and nonsolvent: ethanol. Regardless of the kind of solvent additive employed, when the diffusion coefficient of the nonsolvent is high for a given gelation medium, then the membrane consists of a smooth, defect-free surface and macrovoid-free cross section, and is highly permeable to oxygen. However, using a polymer solution with a low diffusion coefficient results in a membrane of a rather defective morphology. Therefore, it is concluded that the diffusion coefficient of the nonsolvent is a crucial parameter in controlling membrane morphology.},

This new type of materials, based on smectite clays usually rendered hydrophobic through ionic exchange of the sodium interlayer cation with an onium cation, may be prepared via various synthetic routes comprising exfoliation adsorption, in situ intercalative polymerization and melt intercalation. The whole range of polymer matrices is covered, i.e. thermoplastics, thermosets and elastomers. Two types of structure may be obtained, namely intercalated nanocomposites where the polymer chains are sandwiched in between silicate layers and exfoliated nanocomposites where the separated, individual silicate layers are more or less uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix. This new family of materials exhibits enhanced properties at very low filler level, usually inferior to 5wt.%, such as increased Young’s modulus and storage modulus, increase in thermal stability and gas barrier properties and good flame retardancy.}

With the increase of coagulation bath temperature, Da increased continuously when the composition of casting solution was constant.

To showcase the capability of AHTech, we screened a library of 180 small molecules as electrolyte additives for aqueous zinc metal batteries, generating data for training machine learning models to predict Coulombic efficiencies. Key molecular features governing additive performance were elucidated using Shapley Additive exPlanations and Spearman’s correlation, pinpointing high-performance candidates like cis-4-hydroxy-d-proline, which achieved an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.52\% over 200 cycles.

   abstract = {Concerns over reproducibility in science extend to research using existing healthcare data; many observational studies investigating the same topic produce conflicting results, even when using the same data. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centres on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all depression treatments for a set of outcomes, producing 17 718 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with current best practice. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results show good transitivity and consistency between databases, and agree with four out of the five findings from clinical trials. The distribution of effect size estimates reported in the literature reveals an absence of small or null effects, with a sharp cut-off at p = 0.05. No such phenomena were observed in our results, suggesting more complete and more reliable evidence.

   abstract = {Combinatorial strategies are for the first time applied in membrane technology and prove to be a powerful new tool in the search for novel membrane materials. The selected system for this study is a polyimide solvent-resistant nanofiltration membrane prepared via phase inversion. The phase inversion process is a typical membrane synthesis procedure involving a large number of compositional components, which can each be varied in a wide concentration range. The optimization of the membrane dope composition was performed using evolutionary optimization via genetic algorithms. Compared with the best commercially available membranes, a substantially improved membrane performance could be realized, both on the level of membrane selectivity and on that of permeability. The miniaturized high-throughput synthesis procedure could be scaled up successfully when the polymer dope was sufficiently viscous. It can be anticipated that application of combinatorial techniques can potentially lead to major improvements in all fields of membrane technology, for example water treatment, gas separation, and dialysis, not only on the compositional level but also for instance on the level of membrane synthesis posttreatment and operational conditions. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

Over the years, the relative synchronous development of technologies for parallel synthesis and characterization has been accompanied by developments in associated software and information technologies. This Review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the state of the art of the field by selected examples. Technologies developed to aid research on complex materials are covered as well as databases, design of experiment, data-mining technologies, modeling approaches, and evolutionary strategies for development. Different methods for parallel synthesis provide single sample libraries, gradient libraries for electronic or optical materials, similar to polymers and catalysts, and products produced through formulation strategies. Many examples illustrate the variety of isolated solutions and document the barely recognized variety of new methods for the synthesis and analysis of almost any material.

Users can access online reagent data, such as a chemical inventory, to virtually populate wells with experiments and produce instructions to perform the reaction array manually, or with the assistance of a liquid handling robot. After completion of the reaction array, analytical results can be uploaded for facile evaluation, and to guide the next series of experiments. All chemical data, metadata, and results are stored in machine-readable formats that are readily translatable to various software. We also demonstrate the use of phactor™ in the discovery of several chemistries, including the identification of a low micromolar inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, phactor™ has been made available for free academic use in 24- and 96-well formats via an online interface.</p>},

However, limited information is generally reported regarding the sample preparation and imaging parameters used, making it difficult to compare results from different studies. The present study focuses on the influences of sample preparation and imaging parameters on the observed membrane surface properties obtained from SEM images. Polymeric membranes were prepared with different coating metals (gold, gold-palladium and iridium) and coating thicknesses, and imaged with different imaging parameters (magnification, detector, sample orientation). Image analysis was done using a custom Matlab application. The effects were observed both qualitatively and quantitatively (pore size/shape and porosity). All of the sample preparation and imaging parameters affected the observed membrane properties of interest. In general, the membrane properties were less sensitive to the parameters when membranes were coated with iridium than with gold or gold-palladium. Iridium should be used as the coating metal in the studies where coating thickness and/or, one or more imaging parameters need to be varied. The results suggest the need of a standardized SEM procedure for membrane characterization, and clear reporting of the parameters used in any SEM study, to enable appropriate comparison of the results obtained in different studies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This review explores the synergistic application of AI and HTE, highlighting their role in accelerating catalyst discovery, optimizing reaction parameters, and understanding structure-performance relationships. HTE facilitates the rapid preparation, characterization, and evaluation of diverse catalyst formulations, generating large datasets essential for AI model training. Machine learning algorithms, including regression models, neural networks, and active learning frameworks, analyze these datasets to uncover the underlying relationships between the data, predict performance, and optimize experimental workflows in real-time. Case studies across heterogeneous, homogeneous, and electrocatalysis demonstrate significant advancements, including improved reaction selectivity, enhanced material stability, and shorten discovery cycles. The integration of AI with HTE has significantly accelerated discovery cycles, enabling the optimization of catalyst formulations and reaction conditions. Despite these achievements, challenges remain, including reliance on researcher expertise, real-time adaptability, and the complexity of large-scale data analysis. Addressing these limitations through refined experimental protocols, standardized datasets, and interpretable AI models will unlock the full potential of AI-HTE integration.}

To address the vastness of AM design space and the need for experiment, we develop a Bayesian experimental autonomous researcher (BEAR) that combines Bayesian optimization and high-throughput automated experimentation. In addition to rapidly performing experiments, the BEAR leverages iterative experimentation by selecting experiments based on all available results. Using the BEAR, we explore the toughness of a parametric family of structures and observe an almost 60-fold reduction in the number of experiments needed to identify high-performing structures relative to a grid-based search.

ABSTRACT={Porous polymer membranes substantially contribute to an acceleration of sustainability transformation based on the energy efficient separation of liquid and gaseous mixtures. This rapid shift towards sustainable industrial processes leads to an increased demand for specifically tailored membranes. In order to predict membrane performance factors like permeability, selectivity and durability, the membrane formation process by film casting and phase inversion needs to be understood further. 
In recent years, computational models of the membrane formation process have been studied intensely. Their high spatial and temporal resolution allows a detailed quantitative description of phase inversion phenomena. New experimental techniques complement this development, as they provide quantitative data, e.g., on compositional changes of the polymer solution during membrane formation as well as the kinetic progression of the phase separation process. 
This state-of-the-art review compiles computational and experimental approaches that characterize the phase inversion process. We discuss how this methodological pluralism is necessary for improving the tailoring of membrane parameters, but that it is unlikely to be the way to the ultimate goal of a complete description of the evolution of the membrane structure from the initial demixing to the final solidification. Alternatively, we formulate an approach that includes a database of standardized and harmonized membrane performance data based on previously publicized data, as well as the application of artificial neural networks as a new powerful tool to link membrane production parameters to membrane performance.

   abstract = {Synthetic polymers have attracted much attention in tissue engineering due to their ability to modulate biomechanical properties. This study investigated the feasibility of processing poly(-caprolactone) (PCL) homopolymer, PCL-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) diblock, and PCL-PEG-PCL triblock copolymers into three-dimensional porous scaffolds. Properties of the various polymers were investigated by dynamic thermal analysis. The scaffolds were manufactured using the desktop robot-based rapid prototyping technique. Gross morphology and internal three-dimensional structure of scaffolds were identified by scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography, which showed excellent fusion at the filament junctions, high uniformity, and complete interconnectivity of pore networks. The influences of process parameters on scaffolds' morphological and mechanical characteristics were studied. Data confirmed that the process parameters directly influenced the pore size, porosity, and, consequently, the mechanical properties of the scaffolds. The in vitro cell culture study was performed to investigate the influence of polymer nature and scaffold architecture on the adhesion of the cells onto the scaffolds using rabbit smooth muscle cells. Light, scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy showed cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix formation on the surface as well as inside the structure of both scaffold groups. The completely interconnected and highly regular honeycomb-like pore morphology supported bridging of the pores via cell-to-cell contact as well as production of extracellular matrix at later time points. The results indicated that the incorporation of hydrophilic PEG into hydrophobic PCL enhanced the overall hydrophilicity and cell culture performance of PCL-PEG copolymer. However, the scaffold architecture did not significantly influence the cell culture performance in this study. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

In the literature available today, the change in viscosity is carried out only by changing the quantitative and/or qualitative dope solution compositions. However, such an important spinning parameter as temperature should significantly affect the dope solution viscosity. For the first time, the influence of the dope solution viscosity of a constant composition on polysulfone hollow fiber membrane properties was studied. The hollow fiber membranes were obtained by the phase separation method induced by a non-solvent (NIPS). The change in the dope solution temperature was carried out in the temperature range of 17–27 °C, providing a dope solution viscosity range of 34.3–21.6 Pa∙s. This work shows that even in such a narrow temperature range, the properties of polysulfone hollow fiber membranes change significantly. With a decrease in the viscosity in this temperature range, the wall thickness of the hollow fiber membrane decreases by 2.8 times; the permeance for the individual gases He and CO2 increases by 1.6–1.8 times, respectively; the ideal selectivity decreases by 1.12 times; the mean flow pore size increases by 1.63 times; and the surface porosity increases about 3 times.},

In particular, active learning allows us to effectively navigate the search space iteratively to identify promising candidates for guiding experiments and computations. The approach relies on the use of uncertainties and making predictions from a surrogate model together with a utility function that prioritizes the decision making process on unexplored data. We discuss several utility functions and demonstrate their use in materials science applications, impacting both experimental and computational research. We summarize by indicating generalizations to multiple properties and multifidelity data, and identify challenges, future directions and opportunities in the emerging field of materials informatics.},

The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.},

As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, educations, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the `where' and `how' questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at: https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey.},

This paper mainly discusses the future applications of LLMs in dentistry. We introduce two primary LLM deployment methods in dentistry, including automated dental diagnosis and cross-modal dental diagnosis, and examine their potential applications. Especially, equipped with a cross-modal encoder, a single LLM can manage multi-source data and conduct advanced natural language reasoning to perform complex clinical operations. We also present cases to demonstrate the potential of a fully automatic Multi-Modal LLM AI system for dentistry clinical application. While LLMs offer significant potential benefits, the challenges, such as data privacy, data quality, and model bias, need further study.

Conventionally, a molecule graph can be represented either as a graph-structured data or a SMILES text. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of NLP. Although it is natural to utilize LLMs to assist in understanding molecules represented by SMILES, the exploration of how LLMs will impact molecular property prediction is still in its early stage. In this work, we advance towards this objective through two perspectives: zero/few-shot molecular classification, and using the new explanations generated by LLMs as representations of molecules. To be specific, we first prompt LLMs to do in-context molecular classification and evaluate their performance. After that, we employ LLMs to generate semantically enriched explanations for the original SMILES and then leverage that to fine-tune a small-scale LM model for multiple downstream tasks. The experimental results highlight the superiority of text explanations as molecular representations across multiple benchmark datasets, and confirm the immense potential of LLMs in molecular property prediction tasks.

We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method-dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method-sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path-dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.},

Prompts are instructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure specific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can be built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit from combination with other prompt patterns.},

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to these persistent issues. Among these, FalconLLM has shown substantial potential in identifying intricate patterns and complex vulnerabilities, hence crucial in software vulnerability detection. In this paper, for the first time, FalconLLM is being fine-tuned for cybersecurity applications, thus introducing SecureFalcon, an innovative model architecture built upon FalconLLM. SecureFalcon is trained to differentiate between vulnerable and non-vulnerable C code samples. We build a new training dataset, FormAI, constructed thanks to Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and formal verification to evaluate its performance.

We demonstrate an autonomous materials discovery methodology for functional inorganic compounds which allow scientists to fail smarter, learn faster, and spend less resources in their studies, while simultaneously improving trust in scientific results and machine learning tools. This robot science enables science-over-the-network, reducing the economic impact of scientists being physically separated from their labs. The real-time closed-loop, autonomous system for materials exploration and optimization (CAMEO) is implemented at the synchrotron beamline to accelerate the interconnected tasks of phase mapping and property optimization, with each cycle taking seconds to minutes. We also demonstrate an embodiment of human-machine interaction, where human-in-the-loop is called to play a contributing role within each cycle.

By using only a small number of labeled examples, referred to as demonstrations, LLMs can effectively grasp the task at hand through in-context learning. However, the process of selecting appropriate demonstrations has received limited attention in prior work. This paper addresses the issue of identifying the most informative demonstrations for few-shot learning by approaching it as a pool-based Active Learning (AL) problem over a single iteration. Our objective is to investigate how AL algorithms can serve as effective demonstration selection methods for in-context learning. We compare various standard AL algorithms based on uncertainty, diversity, and similarity, and consistently observe that the latter outperforms all other methods, including random sampling. Notably, uncertainty sampling, despite its success in conventional supervised learning scenarios, performs poorly in this context. Our extensive experimentation involving a diverse range of GPT and OPT models across $24$ classification and multi-choice tasks, coupled with thorough analysis, unambiguously demonstrates that in-context example selection through AL prioritizes high-quality examples that exhibit low uncertainty and bear similarity to the test examples.},

Language models have demonstrated their capability to answer domain-specific questions and retrieve information from knowledge bases. However, there are no benchmark datasets in the materials domain that can evaluate the understanding of the key concepts by these language models. In this work, we curate a dataset of 650 challenging questions from the materials domain that require the knowledge and skills of a materials student who has cleared their undergraduate degree. We classify these questions based on their structure and the materials science domain-based subcategories. Further, we evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models on solving these questions via zero-shot and chain of thought prompting. It is observed that GPT-4 gives the best performance (~62% accuracy) as compared to GPT-3.5. Interestingly, in contrast to the general observation, no significant improvement in accuracy is observed with the chain of thought prompting. To evaluate the limitations, we performed an error analysis, which revealed conceptual errors (~64%) as the major contributor compared to computational errors (~36%) towards the reduced performance of LLMs. We hope that the dataset and analysis performed in this work will promote further research in developing better materials science domain-specific LLMs and strategies for information extraction.

   abstract = {Understanding the salt–water separation mechanisms of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes is critical for the further development and optimization of RO technology. The solution-diffusion (SD) model is widely used to describe water and salt transport in RO, but it does not describe the intricate transport mechanisms of water molecules and ions through the membrane. In this study, we develop an ion transport model for RO, referred to as the solution-friction model, by rigorously considering the mechanisms of partitioning and the interactions among water, salt ions, and the membrane. Ion transport through the membrane is described by the extended Nernst–Planck equation, with the consideration of frictions between the species (i.e., ion, water, and membrane matrix). Water flow through the membrane is governed by the hydraulic pressure gradient and the friction between the water and membrane matrix as well as the friction between water and ions. The model is validated using experimental measurements of salt rejection and permeate water flux in a lab-scale, cross-flow RO setup. We then investigate the effects of feed salt concentration and hydraulic pressure on salt permeability, demonstrating strong dependence of salt permeability on feed salt concentration and applied pressure, starkly disparate from the SD model. Lastly, we develop a framework to analyze the pressure drop distribution across the membrane, demonstrating that cross-membrane transport dominates the overall pressure drop in RO, in marked contrast to the SD model that assumes no pressure drop across the membrane.},

Therefore, there is a growing need for testing platforms to rapidly determine the mechanical properties of thin polymer films and coatings. We introduce here an elegant, efficient measurement method that yields the elastic moduli of nanoscale polymer films in a rapid and quantitative manner without the need for expensive equipment or material-specific modelling. The technique exploits a buckling instability that occurs in bilayers consisting of a stiff, thin film coated onto a relatively soft, thick substrate. Using the spacing of these highly periodic wrinkles, we calculate the film's elastic modulus by applying well-established buckling mechanics. We successfully apply this new measurement platform to several systems displaying a wide range of thicknessess (nanometre to micrometre) and moduli (MPa to GPa).},

   abstract = {Since the first successful story was reported in the middle of 1990s, combinatorial materials science has attracted more and more attentions in the materials community. In the past two decades, a great amount of effort has been made to develop combinatorial high-throughput approaches for materials research. However, few high-throughput mechanical characterization methods and tools were reported. To date, a number of micro-scale mechanical characterization tools have been developed, which provided a basis for combinatorial high-throughput mechanical characterization. Many existing micro-mechanical testing apparatuses can be pertinently modified for high-throughput characterization. For example, automated scanning nanoindentation is used for measuring the hardness and elastic modulus of diffusion multiple alloy samples, and cantilever beam arrays are used to parallelly characterize the thermal mechanical behavior of thin films with wide composition gradients. The interpretation of micro-mechanical testing data from thin films and micro-scale samples is most critical and challenging, as the mechanical properties of their bulk counterparts cannot be intuitively extrapolated due to the well-known size and microstructure dependence. Nevertheless, high-throughput mechanical characterization data from combinatorial micro-scale samples still reflect the dependence trend of the mechanical properties on compositions and microstructure, which facilitates the understanding of intrinsic materials behavior and the fast screening of bulk mechanical properties. After the promising compositions and microstructure are pinned down, bulk samples can be prepared to measure the accurate properties and verify the combinatorial high-throughput characterization results. By developing combinatorial high-throughput mechanical characterization methods and tools, in combination with high-throughput synthesis, the structural materials research would be promoted by accelerating the discovery, development, and deployment of high performance structural materials, and by providing full spectrum of materials data for mapping composition-microstructure-mechanical properties. The latter would significantly improve the advanced structural materials design using materials genome engineering approach in the future.},

In this paper, we report on the formation of finger-like macrovoids during non-solvent-induced phase inversion of alumina/PES/NMP suspensions. A membrane structure without such finger-like macrovoids was observed when the suspension was slowly immersed into pure ethanol or a mixture of 70. wt% NMP and 30. wt% water, whereas finger-like macrovoids occurred when the suspension was slid into the non-solvents at higher speeds. We found that the formation process of finger-like macrovoids could be fully or partially reversed when nascent membranes were taken out from water shortly after immersion, depending on the duration of the immersion. Splitting of the fingers during the formation of the macrovoids was also observed during the phase inversion of two alumina/PES/NMP suspensions. These experimental observations were not predicted by current theories of finger-like macrovoid formation in polymer membranes, but appear to mimic the well-known viscous fingering phenomenon. We therefore propose that in the phase inversion of ceramic suspensions, the viscous fingering phenomenon is an important mechanism in the formation of finger-like voids. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Most polymeric membranes are engineered to have high porosity in order to reduce transport resistance of the permeate(s). However, since most polymers are relatively compliant and exhibit time-dependent behavior, such membranes are prone to deformation under mechanical loading that can occur during different stages of manufacturing as well as during separation. Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand the influence of mechanical deformation on the permeability of the membranes. However, an appropriate relationship has not been established due to the lack of methods that can precisely control membrane deformation and the significant variability of membrane properties. Here, we report the systematic and quantitative examination of the permeability-deformation relationship for microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with different pore structure and chemistry. Polymer membranes were deformed to different levels of compressive strain using nanoimprint lithography with systematically different processing conditions. Furthermore, permeation measurements were carried out on each membrane sample before and after the compressive deformation to minimize membrane variability concerns. The experimental results reveal that the permeability of the MF and UF membranes decreases with the increase of compressive strain such that the dependency approaches the behavior of an open-cell foam. The derived relationship is simple but useful despite key differences between open-cell foams and porous membranes including pore structure asymmetry and the much smaller pore size of the latter.},

   abstract = {In this paper, commercially available graphene oxide (GO) was used as nanomaterials to modify polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membrane surface. After functionalization, the membrane surface properties were improved as the water contact angle was reduced from 41.7 ± 4.5⁰ to 26.9 ± 0.9⁰ demonstrating improvement in hydrophilic properties besides decreasing membrane surface roughness. Membrane scaling tests were done in the presence of CaSO4 solution at 20 mM concentration as feedwater showed that the modified membranes (GO@RO) had superior anti-scaling properties. Results indicated that the permeate flux was reduced by only 15% at the end of the scaling experiment as opposed to the bared RO membrane which faced up to 22% decline in flux. The results of scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray diffraction confirmed that the bared RO membrane was extensively scaled by the CaSO4 precipitates. The results of antibacterial tests showed that GO functionalization caused an inhibition of bacterial growth by 81.7% as compared to the unmodified RO membrane. Moreover, experiments were also performed to investigate microbially induced calcium sulfate precipitation on membranes. Overall, it was found that GO functionalization not only reduces biofouling but can also inhibit mineral scaling and microbially induced mineral formation.},

   abstract = {The mechanical properties of virgin and industrially fouled reverse osmosis membranes (composite polyamide) used for the purification and desalination of seawater in desalination processes were characterised using novel atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. Polymeric surface elasticity has previously been demonstrated to strongly affect the adhesion of bacteria; hence the study examined membrane surface elasticity to demonstrate how AFM can be used to assess the bio-fouling potential of membranes. An AFM colloid probe technique was used to determine the mechanical properties of the membrane, the adhesion forces and the work of adhesion at the membrane surfaces. The mean values of Young's modulus for the virgin membrane decreased in magnitude with increasing pH values, where these values were significantly different (p < 0.017) between both pH 3 (1450 kPa), pH 7 (1327 kPa) and pH 9 (788 kPa). These differences were attributed to differences in membrane swelling and indicate possible control parameters that could be exploited to improve membrane cleaning regimes. A membrane with a higher modulus will be stronger and potentially more resistant to chemical and physical processes during operation and cleaning. Significant differences (p < 0.017) in force measurements were also found between different electrolytic conditions for each of the membranes, where for the virgin membrane the adhesion force values were 6.00 nN at pH 3, 1.77 nN at pH 7 and 0.98 N at pH 9, and also the work of adhesion were 153.6 nJ at pH 3, 22.8nJ at pH 7 and 9.9 nJ at pH 9 in 0.6 M NaCl. These observations further confirm the importance of the electrolytic environment on the nanoscale interactions of the membrane which should be considered to control fouling during operation and cleaning cycles. AFM images and streaming potential measurements of virgin and fouled membranes were also obtained to aid analysis of the industrial membrane system. The novel application of AFM to membranes to measure Young's moduli and work of adhesion is a new addition to the AFM tools that can be used to unravel separation processes at the membrane surface. In addition, this study further demonstrates that AFM force spectroscopy can be used as part of a sophisticated membrane autopsy procedure for the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in membrane fouling.},

   abstract = {We present a facile method to enhance separation performance of polyamide (PA) reverse osmosis (RO) membranes via solvent activation with a new type of organic solvent, benzyl alcohol (BA). Activation with BA remarkably improved water permeance (up to ∼140% increase) while maintaining high NaCl rejection (∼99.6%) of the pristine RO membrane, thereby overcoming the flux-rejection trade-off limitation. Thus, the water permeance and permselectivity of the BA-activated RO membrane significantly exceeded those of commercial RO membranes. This significant performance enhancement was attributed to the appropriate solvency power of BA (determined based on Hansen solubility parameters), which led to the balanced structural deformation of the PA selective layer; BA activation produced a less dense and highly permeable PA structure by greatly swelling PA, while simultaneously healing loosened sites via structural compaction of the PA network with a sufficiently reduced modulus. Based on the activation results with various organic solvents ranging from mild to strong solvents, we propose a more reliable predictor of the solvent activation effect. Our strategy is a simple, effective and commercially viable method to enhance RO membrane performance. Additionally, our study highlights on the underlying solvent activating mechanism of PA RO membranes.},

This review extensively covers the numerous lab-scale synthesis protocols used in research labs and proposed mechanisms and kinetics for synthesizing these fully aromatic polyamide layers using IP. Emphasis is placed on the support membrane used and the reaction conditions such as monomer concentration, solution volume, aqueous solution soaking time, reaction time, reaction temperature, and the use of non-reactive additives in the reaction solution. The effect of processing techniques for removing the aqueous solution and for post-reaction cross-linking are discussed. These variables are compared by investigating their effect on the membrane desalination performance. The numerous methods used to characterize the polyamide layers are reviewed. The synthesis of fully aromatic polyamide layers on hollow fiber membranes is briefly discussed. The goal of this review is to discuss the numerous synthesis parameters in reported lab-scale studies for control membranes, which may help researchers to synthesize and improve RO membranes more effectively.},

In this regard, this study aims to experimentally investigate the variation of osmotic membrane performance under varying spacer-induced mechanical compression and determine the critical compression ratio. 3D FEM (Finite element method) mechanical stimulation was employed to analyze the variation of stress and strain of membrane under mechanical compression and critical stress and strain were determined based on the experimental results. The study found that the performance of commercial osmotic membrane did not decrease significantly up to 30–40% of compression ratio and 45.5%–69.6% of the packing density of spiral-wound membrane module can be saved. The findings and methods suggested in this study will facilitate the structural optimization of ODMP membrane modules. Also, the discrepancy of the membrane performance between the lab-scale experiment (non-compressed) and commercial-scale membrane module (compressed) validated in this study emphasizes the importance of caution in the reporting of membrane performance.},

   abstract = {Reverse osmosis (RO) is currently the most important desalination technology and it is experiencing significant growth. The objective of this paper is to review the historical and current development of RO membrane materials which are the key determinants of separation performance and water productivity, and hence to define performance targets for those who are developing new RO membrane materials. The chemistry, synthesis mechanism(s) and desalination performance of various RO membranes are discussed from the point of view of membrane materials science. The review starts with the first generation of asymmetric polymeric membranes and finishes with current proposals for nano-structured membrane materials. The paper provides an overview of RO performance in relation to membrane materials and methods of synthesis.To date polymeric membranes have dominated the RO desalination industry. From the late 1950s to the 1980s the research effort focussed on the search for optimum polymeric membrane materials. In subsequent decades the performance of RO membranes has been optimised via control of membrane formation reactions, and the use of poly-condensation catalysts and additives. The performance of state-of-the-art RO membranes has been highlighted. Nevertheless, the advances in membrane permselectivity in the past decade has been relatively slow, and membrane fouling remains a severe problem.The emergence of nano-technology in membrane materials science could offer an attractive alternative to polymeric materials. Hence nano-structured membranes are discussed in this review including zeolite membranes, thin film nano-composite membranes, carbon nano-tube membranes, and biomimetic membranes. It is proposed that these novel materials represent the most likely opportunities for enhanced RO desalination performance in the future, but that a number of challenges remain with regard to their practical implementation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Historically, the integration of insulators with decreasing dielectric
constants, k, has been critical in improving devices performance.
Themost efficient approach to decrease k is by introducing porosity.
Since porosity directly impacts theYoung'smodulus, the accurate
determination of the mechanical properties of porous dielectrics is
essential in enabling their implementation into state-of-the-art
devices. Currently, nanoindentation is the technique of choice, but as
technology relevant thicknesses of dielectrics keep decreasing,
substrate effects are unavoidably encountered. These issues have so far
been circumvented by measuring bulk materials instead of their thin-film
counterparts. This approach is, however, less than ideal as physical
properties can be size-dependent. Moreover, pores densification also
occurs, potentially leading to overestimated Young's modulus values. In
this paper, we define a novel protocol based on ultra-low load,
quasi-static nanoindentation to measure mechanical properties of porous
thin-films as a function of porosity (0-60%) and thickness (150-700
nm). We could isolate materials densification from substrate effect, and
we demonstrated that the former can be accounted for, while the latter
does not happen until indentation depths are remarkably higher than the
traditionally accepted indentation limit of 10% of the film thickness.
Consequently, extremely accurate mechanical characterization of porous
low-k thin-films is now possible. (c) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

   abstract = {In this paper we show how reliable measurements on porous ceramic films can be made by appropriate nanoindentation experiments and analysis. Room-temperature mechanical properties of the mixed-conducting perovskite material La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O 3-δ (LSCF6428) were investigated by nanoindentation of porous bulk samples and porous films sintered at temperatures from 900 to 1200 C. A spherical indenter was used so that the contact area was much greater than the scale of the porous microstructure. The elastic modulus of the bulk samples was found to increase from 33.8 to 174.3 GPa and hardness from 0.64 to 5.32 GPa as the porosity decreased from 45% to 5% after sintering at 900-1200 C. Densification under the indenter was found to have little influence on the measured elastic modulus. The residual porosity in the "dense" sample was found to account for the discrepancy between the elastic moduli measured by indentation and by impulse excitation. Crack-free LSCF6428 films of acceptable surface roughness for indentation were also prepared by sintering at 900-1200 C. Reliable measurements of the true properties of the films were obtained by data extrapolation provided that the ratio of indentation depth to film thickness was in the range 0.1-0.2. The elastic moduli of the films and bulk materials were approximately equal for a given porosity. The 3-D microstructures of films before and after indentation were characterized using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy tomography. Finite-element modelling of the elastic deformation of the actual microstructures showed excellent agreement with the nanoindentation results. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the boundaries of usability for measuring thin film elastic modulus may differ. Two known material systems of Mo and MoTa thin films on Si substrates are examined with nanoindentation and numerical modeling to show the limitations in measuring elastic moduli. An assessment of the hardness and elastic modulus as a function of contact depth and accurate modeling of the film/substrate deformation confirms the 10% rule for hardness measurements. For elastic modulus, the indentation depths should be much smaller. Results provide a recommended testing protocol for accurate assessment of thin film elastic modulus using nanoindentation.

It is shown that the load–displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load.

   abstract = {Nanoindentation experiments were performed on poly(methyl methacrylate) films deposited on Si(100) substrates to investigate the effects of film thickness, loading rate, and molecular weight on the surface and interface viscoelastic behaviors. The film stiffness increased with the indentation depth due to the increase of the contact area and the effect of the rigid substrate. The film thickness and loading rate exhibited strong effects on the film stiffness, while the molecular weight effect was secondary. For film thickness greater than the unperturbed radius of gyration, the stiffness variation across the film thickness demonstrated the existence of three regimes of different viscoelastic behaviors. The loading rate effect on the viscoelastic behavior of the indented polymer films is interpreted in terms of the confinement between the indenter and the substrate surfaces that restricted the molecular chain mobility in the vicinity of the film/substrate interface. The through-thickness variation of the film stiffness (modified to exclude the viscous component) is examined in the context of a previous indentation model.

Nanoindentation is a most valuable tool for the evaluation of the modulus, hardness and creep enhancements upon incorporation of the filler. It is shown that thermoset, glassy and semicrystalline matrices can exhibit distinct reinforcing mechanisms. The improvement of mechanical properties is found to mainly depend on the nature of the filler and the dispersion and interaction with the matrix. Other factors such as shape, dimensions and degree of orientation of the nanofiller, as well as matrix morphology are discussed. A comparison between nanoindentation results and macroscopic properties is offered. Finally, indentation size effects are also critically examined. Challenges and future perspectives in the application of depth-sensing instrumentation to characterize mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposite materials are suggested. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this article is to review recent archival journal publications dealing with nanoindentation of polymer composites and their constituents, with emphasis on publications that have appeared since 2000. Developments in experimental nanoindentation, numerical simulation of nanoindentation and combined experimental/numerical nanoindentation techniques will be discussed. The review will show that nanoindentation has been particularly useful in the characterization of polymer matrix materials, fibers, particles and other constituent materials in polymer composites. Studies of both indirect and direct measurement of elastic, viscoelastic and dynamic mechanical properties of constituents by nanoindentation are reviewed, along with nanomechanical characterization of composite interface and interphase regions and comparisons of bulk and in situ properties measured by nanoindentation. Finally, some general conclusions and recommendations for future studies are offered.},

However, the typical rates of tens of tests per hour can be significantly improved. These higher testing rates enable otherwise impractical studies requiring several thousands of indents, such as high-resolution property mapping and detailed statistical studies. However, care must be taken to avoid systematic errors in the measurement, including choosing of the indentation depth/spacing to avoid overlap of plastic zones, pileup, and influence of neighboring microstructural features in the material being tested. Furthermore, since fast loading rates are required, the strain rate sensitivity must also be considered. A review of these effects is given, with the emphasis placed on making complimentary standard nanoindentation measurements to address these issues. Experimental applications of the technique, including mapping of welds, microstructures, and composites with varying length scales, along with studying the effect of surface roughness on nominally homogeneous specimens, will be presented.},

Despite the existence of deep learning models for MLP tasks, there are ongoing practical issues associated with complex model architectures, extensive fine-tuning, and substantial human-labelled datasets. Here, we introduce the use of large language models, such as generative pretrained transformer (GPT), to replace the complex architectures of prior MLP models with strategic designs of prompt engineering. We find that in-context learning of GPT models with few or zero-shots can provide high performance text classification, named entity recognition and extractive question answering with limited datasets, demonstrated for various classes of materials. These generative models can also help identify incorrect annotated data. Our GPT-based approach can assist material scientists in solving knowledge-intensive MLP tasks, even if they lack relevant expertise, by offering MLP guidelines applicable to any materials science domain. In addition, the outcomes of GPT models are expected to reduce the workload of researchers, such as manual labelling, by producing an initial labelling set and verifying human-annotations.},

However, the materials science field struggles to effectively utilize the abundance of data, especially in applied disciplines where materials are evaluated based on device performance rather than their properties. This article presents a new natural language processing (NLP) task called structured information inference (SII) to address the complexities of information extraction at the device level in materials science. We accomplished this task by tuning GPT-3 on an existing perovskite solar cell FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) dataset with 91.8% F1-score and extended the dataset with data published since its release. The produced data is formatted and normalized, enabling its direct utilization as input in subsequent data analysis. This feature empowers materials scientists to develop models by selecting high-quality review articles within their domain. Additionally, we designed experiments to predict the electrical performance of solar cells and design materials or devices with targeted parameters using large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate comparable performance to traditional machine learning methods without feature selection, highlighting the potential of LLMs to acquire scientific knowledge and design new materials akin to materials scientists.},

Language models have demonstrated their capability to answer domain-specific questions and retrieve information from knowledge bases. However, there are no benchmark datasets in the materials science domain that can be used to evaluate the understanding of the key concepts by these language models. In this work, we curate a dataset of 650 challenging questions from the materials domain that require the knowledge and skills of a materials science student who has cleared their undergraduate degree. We classify these questions based on their structure and the materials science domain-based subcategories. Further, we evaluate the performance of LLaMA-2-70B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models on solving these questions via zero-shot and chain of thought prompting. It is observed that GPT-4 gives the best performance (∼62% accuracy) as compared to other models. Interestingly, in contrast to the general observation, no significant improvement in accuracy is observed with the chain of thought prompting. To evaluate the limitations, we performed an error analysis, which revealed conceptual errors (∼72%) as the major contributor compared to computational errors (∼28%) towards the reduced performance of the LLMs. We also compared GPT-4 with human performance and observed that GPT-4 is better than an average student and comes close to passing the exam. We also show applications of the best performing model (GPT-4) on composition-extraction from tables of materials science research papers and code writing tasks. While GPT-4 performs poorly on composition extraction, it outperforms all other models on the code writing task. We hope that the dataset, analysis, and applications discussed in this work will promote further research in developing better materials science domain-specific LLMs and strategies for information extraction.},

The small datasets commonly found in chemistry sparked the development of sophisticated machine learning approaches that incorporate chemical knowledge for each application and, therefore, require specialized expertise to develop. Here we show that GPT-3, a large language model trained on vast amounts of text extracted from the Internet, can easily be adapted to solve various tasks in chemistry and materials science by fine-tuning it to answer chemical questions in natural language with the correct answer. We compared this approach with dedicated machine learning models for many applications spanning the properties of molecules and materials to the yield of chemical reactions. Surprisingly, our fine-tuned version of GPT-3 can perform comparably to or even outperform conventional machine learning techniques, in particular in the low-data limit. In addition, we can perform inverse design by simply inverting the questions. The ease of use and high performance, especially for small datasets, can impact the fundamental approach to using machine learning in the chemical and material sciences. In addition to a literature search, querying a pre-trained large language model might become a routine way to bootstrap a project by leveraging the collective knowledge encoded in these foundation models, or to provide a baseline for predictive tasks.},

   abstract = {Objective: This study quantifies the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks and proposes task-specific prompts to improve their performance. Materials and Methods: We evaluated these models on two clinical NER tasks: (1) to extract medical problems, treatments, and tests from clinical notes in the MTSamples corpus, following the 2010 i2b2 concept extraction shared task, and (2) identifying nervous system disorder-related adverse events from safety reports in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). To improve the GPT models' performance, we developed a clinical task-specific prompt framework that includes (1) baseline prompts with task description and format specification, (2) annotation guideline-based prompts, (3) error analysis-based instructions, and (4) annotated samples for few-shot learning. We assessed each prompt's effectiveness and compared the models to BioClinicalBERT. Results: Using baseline prompts, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 scores of 0.634, 0.804 for MTSamples, and 0.301, 0.593 for VAERS. Additional prompt components consistently improved model performance. When all four components were used, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 socres of 0.794, 0.861 for MTSamples and 0.676, 0.736 for VAERS, demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt framework. Although these results trail BioClinicalBERT (F1 of 0.901 for the MTSamples dataset and 0.802 for the VAERS), it is very promising considering few training samples are needed. Conclusion: While direct application of GPT models to clinical NER tasks falls short of optimal performance, our task-specific prompt framework, incorporating medical knowledge and training samples, significantly enhances GPT models' feasibility for potential clinical applications.},

   abstract = {Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are widely used in many sub-fields of natural language processing (NLP) and generally known as excellent few-shot learners with task-specific exemplars. Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting, a recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-by-step answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics and symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard scaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs' ability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding "Let's think step by step" before each answer. Experimental results demonstrate that our Zero-shot-CoT, using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics (MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP), symbolic reasoning (Last Letter, Coin Flip), and other logical reasoning tasks (Date Understanding, Tracking Shuffled Objects), without any hand-crafted few-shot examples, e.g. increasing the accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7% with large InstructGPT model (text-davinci-002), as well as similar magnitudes of improvements with another off-the-shelf large model, 540B parameter PaLM. The versatility of this single prompt across very diverse reasoning tasks hints at untapped and understudied fundamental zero-shot capabilities of LLMs, suggesting high-level, multi-task broad cognitive capabilities may be extracted by simple prompting. We hope our work not only serves as the minimal strongest zero-shot baseline for the challenging reasoning benchmarks, but also highlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous zero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or few-shot exemplars.},

We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.},

This technique has shown particular strength in improving the performance of modestly sized LLMs, sometimes inducing performance competitive with much larger model variants. In this paper we ask two questions: (1) How sensitive are instruction-tuned models to the particular phrasings of instructions, and, (2) How can we make them more robust to such natural language variation? To answer the former, we collect a set of 319 instructions manually written by NLP practitioners for over 80 unique tasks included in widely used benchmarks, and we evaluate the variance and average performance of these instructions as compared to instruction phrasings observed during instruction fine-tuning. We find that using novel (unobserved) but appropriate instruction phrasings consistently degrades model performance, sometimes substantially so. Further, such natural instructions yield a wide variance in downstream performance, despite their semantic equivalence. Put another way, instruction-tuned models are not especially robust to instruction re-phrasings. We propose a simple method to mitigate this issue by introducing ``soft prompt'' embedding parameters and optimizing these to maximize the similarity between representations of semantically equivalent instructions. We show that this method consistently improves the robustness of instruction-tuned models.},

   abstract = {GPT-3 can perform numerous tasks when provided a natural language prompt that contains a few training examples. We show that this type of few-shot learning can be unstable: the choice of prompt format, training examples, and even the order of the training examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance to near state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that this instability arises from the bias of language models towards predicting certain answers, e.g., those that are placed near the end of the prompt or are common in the pre-training data. To mitigate this, we first estimate the model's bias towards each answer by asking for its prediction when given the training prompt and a content-free test input such as "N/A". We then fit calibration parameters that cause the prediction for this input to be uniform across answers. On a diverse set of tasks, this contextual calibration procedure substantially improves GPT-3 and GPT-2's average accuracy (up to 30.0% absolute) and reduces variance across different choices of the prompt.},

This collection of statistical methods has already proved to be capable of considerably speeding up both fundamental and applied research. At present, we are witnessing an explosion of works that develop and apply machine learning to solid-state systems. We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure–property relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science. Finally, we propose solutions and future research paths for various challenges in computational materials science.},

Inspired by their findings, we study few-shot learning in a more practical scenario , where we use smaller language models for which fine-tuning is computationally efficient. We present LM-BFF-better few-shot fine-tuning of language models 1-a suite of simple and complementary techniques for fine-tuning language models on a small number of annotated examples. Our approach includes (1) prompt-based fine-tuning together with a novel pipeline for automating prompt generation ; and (2) a refined strategy for dynamically and selectively incorporating demonstrations into each context. Finally, we present a systematic evaluation for analyzing few-shot performance on a range of NLP tasks, including classification and regression. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods combine to dramatically outperform standard fine-tuning procedures in this low resource setting, achieving up to 30% absolute improvement, and 11% on average across all tasks. Our approach makes minimal assumptions on task resources and domain expertise, and hence constitutes a strong task-agnostic method for few-shot learning. 2},

   abstract = {No two authors write alike. Personal flourishes invoked in written narratives, from lexicon to rhetorical devices, imply a particular author--what literary theorists label the implied or virtual author; distinct from the real author or narrator of a text. Early large language models trained on unfiltered training sets drawn from a variety of discordant sources yielded incoherent personalities, problematic for conversational tasks but proving useful for sampling literature from multiple perspectives. Successes in alignment research in recent years have allowed researchers to impose subjectively consistent personae on language models via instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but whether aligned models retain the ability to model an arbitrary virtual author has received little scrutiny. By studying 4,374 stories sampled from three OpenAI language models, we show successive versions of GPT-3 suffer from increasing degrees of "mode collapse" whereby overfitting the model during alignment constrains it from generalizing over authorship: models suffering from mode collapse become unable to assume a multiplicity of perspectives. Our method and results are significant for researchers seeking to employ language models in sociological simulations.},

Therefore, EMI shielding is essential to ensure electronics equipment safety. The present investigation explores the EMI shielding effectiveness of micro-size cenosphere (2 wt.%, 4 wt.%, and 6 wt.%) filled aluminum matrix syntactic foams. The aluminum matrix syntactic foams were fabricated using stir-casting. The prepared samples were studied for their EMI shielding, microstructural characterization, compressive deformation behavior, and hardness. The cenosphere-filled aluminum syntactic foam exhibited better EMI shielding effectiveness, varied from −41.38 dB to −56.68 dB measured in the frequency range 8 to 12 GHz. This is due to microwave absorption and the dielectric nature of porous cenosphere fillers in the syntactic foam. The highest plateau strength 316.48 MPa and compressive yield strength of 289.53 MPa was achieved in 6 wt% cenosphere-filled syntactic foam. The microstructural study showed the presence of cenospheres in spherical form with homogeneous distribution. The observation shows good bonding between the matrix and cenosphere filler element. The micro-hardness measurement varied from 114 HV to 125.6 HV for the cenosphere filled syntactic foam (up to 4 wt %); further increasing the cenosphere wt% reduced the hardness. The XRD analysis showed the presence of reaction compounds AlSiO2, and Al2SiO5 which enhanced the brittleness in the syntactic foams.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Porous silk fibroin (SF) sponges have been widely used in biomaterials due to their excellent biocompatibility and tunable degradability. However, it remains a challenge to construct porous SF materials with 3D nanofibrous structure mimicking extracellular matrix. In this study, a novel strategy was developed to fabricate SF/cellulose sponges with micro-nano hierarchical structure through using a lithium bromide aqueous solution system. It was found that the cellulose can be partially dissolved by lithium bromide solution to form abundant cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs). Therefore, the porous SF/CNF sponge was directly prepared after dissolving SF/cellulose blend in lithium bromide solution. The structure and performance of sponges can be regulated by adjusting SF/cellulose ratio. Raising the cellulose ratio enhanced the compression strength and water swelling ratio of sponges, but restrained the 3D spatial distribution of CNFs in the pore space. As SF content increased to 50%, CNFs homogeneously dispersed and formed the porous sponges with micro-nano hierarchical structure. FTIR and XRD results showed cellulose II and silk II structure in composites, and suggested the presence of intermolecular interaction between SF and cellulose. The enzymatic degradation results showed that the degradation rate of sponges could be regulated by the SF component, which significantly promoted degradability. The results provide promising scaffold candidate with tunable nanostructure and degradability. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

Data were obtained with two solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes: a laboratory-prepared polyimide (PI) and a commercial MPF-50 membrane.

Solutions to many of the world's problems depend upon materials research and development. However, advanced materials can take decades to discover and decades more to fully deploy. Humans and robots have begun to partner to advance science and technology orders of magnitude faster than humans do today through the development and exploitation of closed-loop, autonomous experimentation systems. This review discusses the specific challenges and opportunities related to materials discovery and development that will emerge from this new paradigm. Our perspective incorporates input from stakeholders in academia, industry, government laboratories, and funding agencies. We outline the current status, barriers, and needed investments, culminating with a vision for the path forward. We intend the article to spark interest in this emerging research area and to motivate potential practitioners by illustrating early successes. We also aspire to encourage a creative reimagining of the next generation of materials science infrastructure. To this end, we frame future investments in materials science and technology, hardware and software infrastructure, artificial intelligence and autonomy methods, and critical workforce development for autonomous research.}

In this study, guided by the tools of data science, a diafiltration apparatus is developed to inform material and process design by rapidly characterizing membrane performance over a broad range of feed solution compositions. The apparatus doses a fixed-concentration diafiltrate solution into a stirred cell to achieve a predetermined change in the retentate concentration. Here, using an 80 mM potassium chloride (KCl) diafiltrate solution, it was shown that membrane performance, within a 5 mM to 80 mM KCl phase space, could be probed five times more quickly with one diafiltration experiment (8 h) than with an experimental campaign using traditional filtration processes (47 h). Additionally, the synergy between data analytics and instrumentation led to the incorporation of an inline conductivity probe that monitored the real-time retentate concentration. This additional information provided key insights to distinguish between the mechanisms that govern membrane separations (e.g., discriminating between adsorption or rejection based separations) and allowed for the membrane transport coefficients to be determined accurately. Ultimately, incorporating the appropriate governing phenomena identified a single set of self consistent transport parameters for commercial NF90 membranes.}

abstract = {Conventional water resources in many regions are insufficient to meet the water needs of growing populations, thus reuse is gaining acceptance as a method of water supply augmentation. Recent advancements in membrane technology have allowed for the reclamation of municipal wastewater for the production of drinking water, i.e., potable reuse. Although public perception can be a challenge, potable reuse is often the least energy-intensive method of providing additional drinking water to water stressed regions. A variety of membranes have been developed that can remove water contaminants ranging from particles and pathogens to dissolved organic compounds and salts. Typically, potable reuse treatment plants use polymeric membranes for microfiltration or ultrafiltration in conjunction with reverse osmosis and, in some cases, nanofiltration. Membrane properties, including pore size, wettability, surface charge, roughness, thermal resistance, chemical stability, permeability, thickness and mechanical strength, vary between membranes and applications. Advancements in membrane technology including new membrane materials, coatings, and manufacturing methods, as well as emerging membrane processes such as membrane bioreactors, electrodialysis, and forward osmosis have been developed to improve selectivity, energy consumption, fouling resistance, and/or capital cost. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the role of polymeric membranes and process components in the treatment of wastewater to potable water quality and to highlight recent advancements and needs in separation processes. Beyond membranes themselves, this review covers the background and history of potable reuse, and commonly used potable reuse process chains, pretreatment steps, and advanced oxidation processes. Key trends in membrane technology include novel configurations, materials, and fouling prevention techniques. Challenges still facing membrane-based potable reuse applications, including chemical and biological contaminant removal, membrane fouling, and public perception, are highlighted as areas in need of further research and development.}

    abstract = {Membranes are widely used for gas and liquid separations. Historical analysis of a range of gas pair separations indicated that there was an upper bound on the trade-off between membrane permeability, which limits flow rates, and the selectivity, which limits the quality of the separation process. Park et al. review the advances that have been made in attempts to break past this upper bound. Some inspiration has come from biological membranes. The authors also highlight cases where the challenges lie in areas other than improved separation performance. Science, this issue p. eaab0530 Increasing demands for energy-efficient separations in applications ranging from water purification to petroleum refining, chemicals production, and carbon capture have stimulated a vigorous search for novel, high-performance separation membranes. Synthetic membranes suffer a ubiquitous, pernicious trade-off: highly permeable membranes lack selectivity and vice versa. However, materials with both high permeability and high selectivity are beginning to emerge. For example, design features from biological membranes have been applied to break the permeability-selectivity trade-off. We review the basis for the permeability-selectivity trade-off, state-of-the-art approaches to membrane materials design to overcome the trade-off, and factors other than permeability and selectivity that govern membrane performance and, in turn, influence membrane design.}

   abstract = {With the rise of self-driving labs (SDLs) and automated experimentation across chemical and materials sciences, there is a considerable challenge in designing the best autonomous lab for a given problem based on published studies alone. Determining what digital and physical features are germane to a specific study is a critical aspect of SDL design that needs to be approached quantitatively. Even when controlling for features such as dimensionality, every experimental space has unique requirements and challenges that influence the design of the optimal physical platform and algorithm. Metrics such as optimization rate are therefore not necessarily indicative of the capabilities of an SDL across different studies. In this perspective, we highlight some of the critical metrics for quantifying performance in SDLs to better guide researchers in implementing the most suitable strategies. We then provide a brief review of the existing literature under the lens of quantified performance as well as heuristic recommendations for platform and experimental space pairings.},

While prior examples have demonstrated successful models for some applications, many more applications exist where machine learning can make a strong impact. To enable faster development of machine-learning-based models for such applications, we have created a framework capable of being applied to a broad range of materials data. Our method works by using a chemically diverse list of attributes, which we demonstrate are suitable for describing a wide variety of properties, and a novel method for partitioning the data set into groups of similar materials to boost the predictive accuracy. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how this new method can be used to predict diverse properties of crystalline and amorphous materials, such as band gap energy and glass-forming ability.},

LLMs' ability of general-purpose language understanding and generation is acquired by training billions of model's parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted by scaling laws \cite\{kaplan2020scaling,hoffmann2022training\}. The research area of LLMs, while very recent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways. In this paper, we review some of the most prominent LLMs, including three popular LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss their characteristics, contributions and limitations. We also give an overview of techniques developed to build, and augment LLMs. We then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluation metrics, and compare the performance of several popular LLMs on a set of representative benchmarks. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing open challenges and future research directions.},

@report{,
   abstract = {By leveraging the retrieval of information from external knowledge databases, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities for accomplishing many knowledge-intensive tasks. However, due to the inherent flaws of current retrieval systems, there might exist irrelevant information within those retrieving top-ranked passages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the robustness of LLMs to different types of irrelevant information under various conditions. We initially introduce a framework to construct high-quality irrelevant information that ranges from semantically unrelated, partially related, and related to questions. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the constructed irrelevant information not only scores highly on similarity metrics, being highly retrieved by existing systems, but also bears semantic connections to the context. Our investigation reveals that current LLMs still face challenges in discriminating highly semantically related information and can be easily distracted by these irrelevant yet misleading contents. Besides, we also find that current solutions for handling irrelevant information have limitations in improving the robust-ness of LLMs to such distractions.
