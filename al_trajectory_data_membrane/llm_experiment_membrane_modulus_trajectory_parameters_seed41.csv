# Recommended Next Experiment

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Auto | True | Maintain automation for consistency |
| Heating | True | Try heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement |
| Concentration | 19.0 | Increase polymer concentration as higher concentrations typically yield higher modulus |
| Heating Block Temperature | 40 | Moderate heating to enhance polymer dissolution without degradation |
| Mixed | True | Use robot mixing for better homogeneity |
| Rest Time (days) | 1 | Allow some time for solution equilibration and removal of air bubbles |
| Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min) | 2.0 | Introduce slight delay to allow initial skin formation |
| Relative Humidity | 60 | Lower humidity than previous experiment to control evaporation rate |
| Nitrogen (Side from drop) | 1 | Introduce nitrogen flow to create more controlled atmosphere |
| Nitrogen (After blade) | 1 | Maintain consistent atmosphere after casting |

This combination aims to create conditions for higher polymer chain entanglement and more controlled phase separation, which should lead to a membrane with improved mechanical properties and higher modulus.",270.69323356331364,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two observations provided, I can see that the second experiment (Index 19) produced a significantly higher modulus (270.69 bar) compared to the first experiment (171.0 bar). This suggests several parameters that may positively influence modulus:

## Analysis of Key Differences
- **Heating**: Changed from False to True
- **Heating Block Temperature**: Increased from 25°C to 50°C
- **Rest Time**: Increased from 0 to 1 day
- **Relative Humidity**: Increased from 82% to 96%

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: True (maintain automation for consistency)
- **Heating**: True (appears beneficial for modulus)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (slight increase from 17% to potentially improve polymer chain entanglement)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 55°C (slight increase to explore if higher temperature further improves modulus)
- **Mixed**: False (maintain consistency with previous experiments)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 2 (increase to see if longer polymer relaxation time improves modulus)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0 (maintain consistency)
- **Relative Humidity**: 95% (maintain high humidity which appears beneficial)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain consistency)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain consistency)

This experiment builds on the successful parameters from the higher-modulus experiment while making strategic adjustments to potentially further increase the modulus.",65.48719407925006,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three prior observations, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. The highest modulus (270.69 bar) was achieved with:
   - Higher concentration (17%)
   - Heating (True)
   - Higher heating block temperature (50°C)
   - Rest time of 1 day
   - High relative humidity (96%)

2. When concentration was reduced to 13% (experiment #18), the modulus dropped significantly to 65.49 bar.

3. Without heating (experiment #38), the modulus was moderate (171.0 bar) despite the same 17% concentration.

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters:

- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process for consistency)
- **Heating**: True (heating appears beneficial for higher modulus)
- **Concentration**: 20.0% (increase from 17% to potentially further improve modulus)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 55°C (slightly increase from 50°C)
- **Mixed**: False (the highest modulus was achieved without mixing)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 1 (maintain the optimal rest time from best result)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0 (maintain zero wait time)
- **Relative Humidity**: 96% (maintain the high humidity from best result)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain consistency with prior experiments)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain consistency with prior experiments)

This experiment builds on the conditions that produced the highest modulus while strategically increasing polymer concentration and heating temperature, which appear to be key factors positively influencing the elastic modulus.",172.0732296612731,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment that should maximize the elastic modulus.

## Analysis of Prior Observations

Looking at the data, I observe several trends:
- The highest modulus (270.69 bar) was achieved with experiment #19
- Higher concentration (17%) appears to yield higher modulus compared to lower concentration (13%)
- Heating (True) seems beneficial for modulus
- Higher relative humidity (96%) correlates with higher modulus
- Rest time of 1 day appears beneficial compared to 0 days

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters

I recommend the following parameters for your next experiment:

- Auto: True
- Heating: True
- Concentration: 20.0 (increasing from 17.0 to explore upper range)
- Heating Block Temperature: 55 (slightly higher than previous best)
- Mixed: False (consistent with best result)
- Rest Time (days): 2 (extending from 1 day to explore if longer rest improves properties)
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0 (consistent with best result)
- Relative Humidity: 96 (maintaining high humidity that yielded best results)
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0 (consistent with previous experiments)
- Nitrogen (After blade): 0 (consistent with previous experiments)

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus of the membranes:

1. The highest modulus (270.69 bar) was achieved with experiment #19, which had:
   - Higher concentration (17%)
   - Heating (True)
   - Higher heating block temperature (50°C)
   - Higher relative humidity (96%)
   - 1 day rest time

2. When concentration was reduced to 13% (experiment #18), the modulus dropped significantly to 65.49 bar.

3. When relative humidity was reduced from 96% to 53% (experiment #17 vs #19), the modulus decreased from 270.69 to 172.07 bar.

4. Adding nitrogen after blade (experiment #55) showed a positive effect compared to similar conditions without it.

## Recommended Next Experiment:

```
Index: Next available
Auto: True
Heating: True
Concentration: 20.0 (increasing from 17.0 to explore upper range)
Heating Block Temperature: 50
Mixed: False
Rest Time (days): 1
Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0
Relative Humidity: 96
Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0

```

## Rationale:
- Increasing polymer concentration to 20% (upper range) as higher concentration (17% vs 13%) showed significantly better modulus
- Maintaining heating at 50°C which produced the best results
- Keeping high relative humidity (96%) which was associated with the highest modulus
- Adding nitrogen after blade which showed positive effects in experiment #55
- Maintaining 1 day rest time which was present in the best-performing experiment
- Not mixing the solution as the best result came from unmixed solution

This experiment builds on the conditions that produced the highest modulus while exploring the potential benefits of higher concentration and adding nitrogen after blade casting.",197.8404462303588,296.35081017123304,Continuing

## Recommended Next Experiment

I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment:

- Auto: True

- Mixed: False
- Rest Time (days): 1
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0
- Relative Humidity: 96%

- Nitrogen (After blade): 1

## Rationale

This recommendation combines the best elements from the previous experiments:
- Maintains the high concentration (increased to maximum in range)
- Keeps heating at 50°C which showed good results
- Maintains the 1-day rest time that was present in the highest-modulus experiment
- Maintains the high humidity (96%) from the best experiment
- Adds nitrogen after blade which showed positive effects in experiment #55

This combination of parameters should provide the best chance of achieving an even higher elastic modulus than previously observed.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
