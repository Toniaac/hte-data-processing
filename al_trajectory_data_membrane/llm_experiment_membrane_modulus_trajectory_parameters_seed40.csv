|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Auto | True | Maintain automation for consistency |
| Heating | True | Try heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement |
| Concentration | 19.0 | Increase polymer concentration as higher concentrations typically yield higher modulus |
| Heating Block Temperature | 40 | Moderate heating to enhance polymer dissolution without degradation |
| Mixed | True | Use robot mixing for better homogeneity |

Based on the two prior observations, I can identify some patterns that may lead to higher modulus values:

1. The second experiment (Index 19) yielded a significantly higher modulus (270.69 bar) compared to the first experiment (211.51 bar).
2. Key differences that may have contributed to this improvement include:
   - Heating (True vs False)
   - Heating Block Temperature (50°C vs 25°C)
   - Rest Time (1 day vs 0 days)
   - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (0 min vs 10 min)
   - Relative Humidity (96% vs 68%)
   - Nitrogen (After blade) (0 vs 1)

   - Rest Time: Increased to 2 days (extending from 0 to 1 day, which showed improvement)
   - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time: Kept at 0.0 min (associated with higher modulus)
   - Relative Humidity: 95% (maintaining the high humidity that was associated with higher modulus)

Based on the provided experimental data, I can make the following observations:

1. The highest modulus (270.69 bar) was achieved with:
   - Higher concentration (17%)
   - Heating (True)
   - Higher heating block temperature (50°C)
   - Rest time of 1 day
   - No wait time before bath immersion
   - High relative humidity (96%)
   - No nitrogen flow

2. The lowest modulus (65.49 bar) occurred with:
   - Lower concentration (13%)
   - Other parameters similar to the highest modulus experiment

3. The medium modulus (211.51 bar) had:
   - Higher concentration (17%)
   - No heating
   - Lower temperature (25°C)
   - Longer coupon-to-bath wait time (10 min)
   - Lower humidity (68%)
   - Nitrogen after blade (1)

- **Heating**: Maintained as True since it appears beneficial
- **Heating Block Temperature**: Increased to 60°C to explore if higher temperature further improves modulus
- **Rest Time**: Increased to 2 days to see if longer polymer chain relaxation improves mechanical properties
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: Kept at 0 minutes as immediate immersion showed better results
- **Relative Humidity**: Maintained at 96% as high humidity correlated with higher modulus
- **Nitrogen Flow**: Kept off as the highest modulus was achieved without nitrogen flow

2. Concentration appears significant - 17% concentration generally yields higher modulus than 13% (compare experiments #19 vs #18).

3. Heating seems beneficial - experiments with heating (True) and higher heating block temperature (50°C) produced higher modulus values.

4. Rest time of 1 day appears optimal compared to 0 or 4 days.
