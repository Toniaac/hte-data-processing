The observation shows a composition with CsPbI = 0.16, FAPbI = 0.84, and MAPbI = 0.0, which resulted in an instability index of 57484.0 (where lower values would indicate better stability).

For my suggestion, I'll recommend increasing the cesium content while decreasing the formamidinium content, as cesium often contributes to better structural stability in perovskites:

**Suggested composition to test next:**
- CsPbI: 0.30
- FAPbI: 0.70
- MAPbI: 0.00

This adjustment increases the cesium content which may help improve the structural stability while maintaining a methylammonium-free composition, which is often beneficial for thermal stability.",456484,23707,Continuing

The data shows:
- Composition 1: CsPbI (0.16), FAPbI (0.84), MAPbI (0.0) had an instability index of 57,484
- Composition 2: CsPbI (0.84), FAPbI (0.0), MAPbI (0.16) had a much higher instability index of 456,484

The first composition with higher FAPbI content showed significantly better stability (lower instability index). This suggests that increasing the FAPbI component while maintaining some CsPbI might be beneficial.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.25
FAPbI: 0.75
MAPbI: 0.0

This composition:
- Slightly increases CsPbI from the more stable composition
- Maintains a high FAPbI content
- Continues to exclude MAPbI which was present in the less stable composition

This will help determine if a slightly higher CsPbI content can further improve stability while maintaining the benefits of the FAPbI-rich composition.",293210,23707,Continuing

2. Cs₀.₈₄MA₀.₁₆Pb₁I₃ had instability indices of 456,484 and 293,210 (much higher/worse)

The composition with the highest FA content and lowest Cs content showed the best stability. This suggests that increasing FA content may be beneficial for stability in these systems.

I recommend testing:
**Cs₀.₁₀FA₀.₉₀MA₀.₀₀Pb₁I₃**

This composition:
- Increases the FA content slightly from the best performing sample
- Reduces the Cs content slightly
- Maintains zero MA content (as MA appears to worsen stability based on the data)

The composition with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 showed the lowest instability index (57484), suggesting that higher FAPbI content with some CsPbI might be promising for stability.

For the next test, I suggest:
**CsPbI: 0.20, FAPbI: 0.80, MAPbI: 0.00**

For the next composition, I suggest:

**CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0**

This continues the trend of slightly increasing the CsPbI content while maintaining zero MAPbI, as the data suggests that compositions with higher FAPbI and lower CsPbI (but not too low) tend to have better stability, and compositions without MAPbI appear more stable.",144074,23707,Continuing

The second lowest instability index (91,681) was observed with:

This suggests that compositions with higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content (with no MAPbI) tend to have better stability. However, when CsPbI was increased to 0.25, the instability increased again.

For the next test, I suggest exploring a composition between the two best performers:

This composition is between the two best performing samples (CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84 and CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82), allowing us to further refine the optimal ratio in this promising region of the composition space.",227835,23707,Continuing
