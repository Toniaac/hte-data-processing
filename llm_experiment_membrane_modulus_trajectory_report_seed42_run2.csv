Based on the single data point provided (Experiment ID 12), I'll recommend parameters that are likely to increase the elastic modulus for your next membrane synthesis experiment.

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment:

- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Solution**: 18% polysulfone in PolarClean solvent (increased concentration)
- **Solution Preparation**: 
  - Automatically mixed by robotic system (Mixed: Yes)
  - Apply heating during mixing (Heating: Yes)
  - Heating block temperature: 60°C
  - Solution rest time: 1 day

## Casting Conditions:
- **Environmental Conditions**: 30% relative humidity
- **Casting Process**:
  - Automated blade casting
  - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time: 2 minutes
  - Apply nitrogen flow after blade casting (Nitrogen (After blade): Yes)
  - No nitrogen flow from side during drop (Nitrogen (Side from drop): No)

## Rationale:
1. **Higher polymer concentration** (18% vs 10%) should increase mechanical strength and modulus
2. **Heating during mixing** will improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement
3. **Lower humidity** (30% vs 56%) may slow the initial phase separation, leading to denser membrane structure
4. **Adding a short wait time** (2 min) before immersion allows for controlled solvent evaporation
5. **Nitrogen flow after blade casting** helps create a more uniform top layer

These parameters aim to create a denser, more mechanically robust membrane structure that should exhibit higher elastic modulus compared to the previous experiment.",65.48719407925006,296.35081017123304,Continuing
2,65,Index: 15; Auto: True; Heating: True; Concentration: 11.63; Heating Block Temperature: 50; Mixed: True; Rest Time (days): 0; Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0; Relative Humidity: 69; Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0; Nitrogen (After blade): 0,"Based on the two experimental reports provided, I'll analyze the parameters that appear to influence the elastic modulus and recommend the next experiment to maximize this property.

## Analysis of Previous Results:
- Experiment #12: 10.0% polysulfone, no heating, 2 days rest, 56% RH, 0 min wait time, no nitrogen flow → Modulus: 39.59 bar
- Experiment #18: 13.0% polysulfone, heating at 50°C, 1 day rest, 96% RH, 0 min wait time, no nitrogen flow → Modulus: 65.49 bar

The higher modulus in Experiment #18 suggests that increased polymer concentration, heating during mixing, and higher humidity may positively impact the modulus.

## Recommended Next Experiment:

- **Auto**: Yes (fully automated synthesis)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 15.0% (increasing from 13.0% as higher concentration appears beneficial)
- **Heating**: Yes
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C (slightly higher than previous 50°C)
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (maintained from successful Experiment #18)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 min (immediate immersion, consistent with previous experiments)
- **Relative Humidity**: 95% (maintaining high humidity similar to Experiment #18)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This experiment builds on the successful parameters from Experiment #18 while further increasing polymer concentration and heating temperature, which should promote stronger polymer chain entanglement and potentially result in a membrane with higher elastic modulus.",90.99870959544364,296.35081017123304,Continuing

- Experiment #15: 11.63% concentration, 50°C heating, 0 days rest, 69% RH → 91.0 bar modulus

## Key Observations:
1. Heating appears beneficial (both experiments with heating had higher modulus)
2. Higher humidity correlates with higher modulus (up to a point)
3. Shorter rest time may be beneficial (best result had 0 days rest)
4. Concentration shows a non-linear relationship (11.63% gave better results than 10% or 13%)

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Concentration**: 12.0% (optimizing around the best result of 11.63%)
- **Heating**: Yes (heating block temperature: 50°C)
- **Mixed**: Yes (by robot)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 75% (exploring slightly higher than the best result)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No
- **Auto**: Yes (fully automated process)

Based on the provided experimental data, I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus.

## Analysis of Previous Results:
- Experiment #12: 10.0% concentration, no heating, 2 days rest, 56% RH → 39.59 bar modulus
- Experiment #18: 13.0% concentration, 50°C heating, 1 day rest, 96% RH → 65.49 bar modulus

- Experiment #16: 11.63% concentration, 50°C heating, 1 day rest, 53% RH → 64.3 bar modulus

## Key Observations:
1. Heating at 50°C appears beneficial for higher modulus
2. Higher humidity (69%) combined with no rest time produced the highest modulus
3. Concentration around 11-13% seems optimal
4. Immediate immersion (0 min wait time) was used in all experiments

   - Heated mixing at 50°C
   - 0 days rest time
   - 69% relative humidity
   - No nitrogen flow
   - Immediate immersion (0 min wait time)

2. I'm recommending a slight increase in polymer concentration (to 12.0%) and heating temperature (to 55°C) to explore if these parameters can further enhance the modulus while maintaining other conditions that have proven successful.

3. The 0 days rest time appears beneficial for higher modulus compared to experiments with 1-2 days rest time.

4. High humidity (around 69-70%) seems to correlate with higher modulus values in the successful experiments.

This recommendation aims to build upon the most successful previous experiments while making targeted adjustments to potentially further optimize the elastic modulus.",42.736240369816734,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% polysulfone
- **Heating**: Yes
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 50°C

- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (197.84 bar) was observed in Experiment #50, which used a high polymer concentration (17%), premixed solution, no rest time, brief wait time before bath immersion, and nitrogen flow after blade casting.

2. I've increased the polymer concentration slightly to 18% as higher concentrations appear to correlate with higher modulus values.

3. I've added heating (50°C) which was beneficial in experiments #14 and #15 that showed high modulus values.

4. The combination of premixed solution, immediate use (0 days rest), and nitrogen flow after blade casting appears to be optimal based on the highest performing experiment.

5. The brief wait time (0.17 min) before bath immersion appears to be better than immediate immersion for maximizing modulus.

- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (critical for controlling humidity exposure)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (ambient)

## Rationale
The highest modulus values (197.84 and 168.33 bar) were observed in experiments #50 and #51, which shared several key parameters: high polymer concentration (17%), premixed solution, immediate use (0 days rest), high humidity (70%), and nitrogen flow after blade casting. The main difference was the wait time before bath immersion (0.17 vs 1.0 minutes).

- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (apply nitrogen flow after blade casting)
