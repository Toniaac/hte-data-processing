After mixing, the solution was rested for 1 day in a sample vial before blade casting.

The membrane was synthesized on November 15, 2024, under 50% relative humidity conditions. The polymer solution was blade-cast onto the coupon and immediately immersed into the NIPS bath without any wait time. No nitrogen gas flow was applied either from the side during drop-casting or after blade casting.

This experiment was part of Batch 34 in the ongoing series of automated membrane synthesis trials. The automated process ensures consistency and reproducibility in membrane production, while the specific parameters chosen allow for the investigation of membrane formation under standard atmospheric conditions without additional drying or humidity control measures."
