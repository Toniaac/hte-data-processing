Looking at the single data point provided, we have a composition with moderate P3HT content (39.05%) and relatively high D1 content (41.85%) that achieved good conductivity (220.57 S/cm). Since D1 appears to be a significant component in this successful formulation, I would suggest increasing its concentration while maintaining a similar P3HT level.

1. Maintains a substantial P3HT content
2. Increases the D1 content, which may be contributing positively to conductivity
3. Keeps small amounts of D2, D6, and D8 to maintain diversity in the carbon nanotube components
