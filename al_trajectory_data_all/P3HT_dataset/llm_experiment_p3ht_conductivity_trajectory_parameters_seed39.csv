P3HT: 45.00%

D2: 8.00%
D6: 0.50%
D8: 1.50%

This composition:
- Maintains P3HT in the optimal range (40-55%)
- Uses high D1 content similar to the best performers
- Slightly increases D2 content to explore if higher values might improve conductivity
- Keeps D6 low but not zero
- Includes a small amount of D8

Looking at the data, I observe several key trends:

1. The highest conductivity values (>600 S/cm) occur when:
   - P3HT content is between 38-55%
   - D1 content is relatively high (38-55%)
   - D2, D6, and D8 contents are generally low

2. The sample with the highest conductivity (660.0 S/cm) has:
   - P3HT: 44.3%
   - D1: 54.68%
   - Very low amounts of D2, D6, and D8

3. Compositions with high D1 content consistently show superior conductivity compared to those with high D2, D6, or D8 content.

Based on these observations, I suggest testing the following composition:

P3HT: 40.00%
D1: 60.00%
D2: 0.00%
D6: 0.00%
D8: 0.00%

Rationale:
- This composition maximizes D1 content within the allowed range (0-60%)
- It maintains P3HT in the optimal range observed in high-performing samples
- It eliminates the other components which appear to reduce conductivity when present in significant amounts
- This exact composition has already shown excellent results (634.35 S/cm and 490.06 S/cm), but testing it again would help confirm reproducibility and potentially identify the upper limit of performance for this system",452.8,1243.67,Continuing
