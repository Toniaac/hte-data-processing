The current composition (CsPbI: 0.44, FAPbI: 0.55, MAPbI: 0.01) shows a high instability index of 206,695, indicating poor stability.

For my recommendation, I'll consider that:
1. MAPbI is known to have lower stability than CsPbI and FAPbI
2. CsPbI typically contributes to better thermal stability
3. A balanced composition between CsPbI and FAPbI often yields better results

Suggested next composition to test:
CsPbI: 0.60
FAPbI: 0.40
MAPbI: 0.00

This composition:
- Increases the CsPbI content for better stability
- Reduces FAPbI slightly
- Eliminates MAPbI completely since it had minimal presence and tends to reduce stability
- Maintains the proper stoichiometry (components sum to 1.00)",209698,23707,Continuing

I suggest testing:
CsPbI: 0.50

MAPbI: 0.00

This composition increases the CsPbI content while maintaining a balance with FAPbI, which may further improve stability based on the trend observed.

1. Low CsPbI (~0.13), high FAPbI (~0.87), and very low or no MAPbI
2. Moderate CsPbI (~0.38), moderate-high FAPbI (~0.62), and no MAPbI

Since the absolute best result came from CsPbI: 0.13, FAPbI: 0.87, MAPbI: 0.0, I suggest exploring nearby compositions to see if we can further optimize stability.

Next composition to test:
CsPbI: 0.15, FAPbI: 0.85, MAPbI: 0.0

This slightly increases the CsPbI content while maintaining the high FAPbI content that appears beneficial for stability, based on the current best results.",59211,23707,Continuing
43,112,"CsPbI: 0.13, FAPbI: 0.87, MAPbI: 0.0, Instability index: 23707.0","Based on the experimental data provided, I notice that the composition with the lowest instability index (59211) is:
CsPbI: 0.13, FAPbI: 0.87, MAPbI: 0.0

This composition appears to be significantly more stable than others tested. I also observe that the second most stable composition (80413) has identical component ratios, suggesting this region of the composition space is promising.

Looking at the overall trend, compositions with higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content (around 0.13) with minimal or no MAPbI appear to yield the most stable perovskites.

For the next composition to test, I recommend:
CsPbI: 0.15, FAPbI: 0.85, MAPbI: 0.0

This slightly increases the CsPbI content while maintaining the high FAPbI content that appears beneficial, allowing us to explore whether the optimal CsPbI content might be slightly higher than 0.13.",23707,23707,Min instability index reached
