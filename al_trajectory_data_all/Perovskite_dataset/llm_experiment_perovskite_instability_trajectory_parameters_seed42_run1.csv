The observation shows a composition with CsPbI = 0.16, FAPbI = 0.84, and MAPbI = 0.0, which resulted in an instability index of 57484.0 (where lower values would indicate better stability).

For my suggestion, I'll recommend increasing the cesium content while decreasing the formamidinium content, as cesium often contributes to better structural stability in perovskites:

**Suggested composition to test next:**
- CsPbI: 0.30
- FAPbI: 0.70
- MAPbI: 0.00

This adjustment increases the cesium content which may help improve the structural stability while maintaining a methylammonium-free composition, which is often beneficial for thermal stability.",456484,23707,Continuing

The first composition (CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0) showed a much lower instability index (57,484) compared to the second composition (CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16) which had a very high instability index (456,484).

This suggests that:
1. Higher FAPbI content appears beneficial for stability
2. The combination of CsPbI with FAPbI seems more stable than CsPbI with MAPbI

For the next composition to test, I recommend:

CsPbI: 0.10
FAPbI: 0.90
MAPbI: 0.00

This composition increases the FAPbI content slightly from the more stable first composition while reducing the CsPbI content, which might further improve stability based on the trend observed.",293210,23707,Continuing

Looking at the instability indices:
- Cs₀.₁₆FA₀.₈₄Pb₁I₃ had the lowest instability index (57,484)
- Cs₀.₈₄MA₀.₁₆Pb₁I₃ had much higher instability indices (456,484 and 293,210)

The composition with the highest FA content and lowest Cs content showed the best stability. This suggests that increasing FA content while maintaining some Cs for structural stability might be beneficial.

I recommend testing:
**Cs₀.₂₀FA₀.₈₀Pb₁I₃** (CsPbI: 0.20, FAPbI: 0.80, MAPbI: 0.00)

This composition slightly increases the Cs content compared to the most stable sample while maintaining a high FA content. This might help find the optimal balance between the stabilizing effects of Cs and the favorable properties of FA.",91681,23707,Continuing

- CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0 → Instability: 91,681
- CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16 → Instability: 293,210 and 456,484

The data suggests that compositions with higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content show better stability (lower instability index). The best result came from the composition with no MAPbI.

For the next test, I suggest:

Parameters: CsPbI: 0.12, FAPbI: 0.88, MAPbI: 0.0

This continues the trend of increasing FAPbI while decreasing CsPbI from the most stable composition observed so far, to see if further improvements in stability can be achieved.",286689,23707,Continuing

- CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0 showed instability of 91681
- CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16 showed high instability (456484 and 293210)

The composition with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 showed the lowest instability index in one test (57484), suggesting that mixtures with higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content might be promising.

I suggest testing:
CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0

This composition:
1. Maintains the promising FA-rich, MA-free approach
2. Slightly increases the Cs content compared to the best performing sample
3. Avoids the high-Cs compositions that showed very high instability",144074,23707,Continuing

Looking at the data patterns:
- Compositions with FAPbI around 0.75-0.84 and CsPbI around 0.16-0.25 (with no MAPbI) show varying instability indices
- The lowest instability index observed was 57,484 with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0
- However, the same composition also showed a much higher instability (286,689) in another test
- Compositions with higher CsPbI content (0.84) and some MAPbI (0.16) showed very high instability

I suggest testing:
Parameters: CsPbI: 0.30, FAPbI: 0.70, MAPbI: 0.00

Rationale:
- We're seeing a potential trend where moderate CsPbI content with high FAPbI content might yield better stability
- The 0.25 CsPbI / 0.75 FAPbI composition showed reasonable stability
- Incrementally increasing the CsPbI content while maintaining zero MAPbI could help identify an optimal balance

The second best result came from CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0 with an instability index of 91,681.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

This suggests that compositions with higher FAPbI content (around 0.84-0.85) and lower CsPbI content (around 0.13-0.16) with minimal or no MAPbI tend to be more stable.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

Parameters: CsPbI: 0.15, FAPbI: 0.85, MAPbI: 0.0
