The observation shows a composition with CsPbI = 0.16, FAPbI = 0.84, and MAPbI = 0.0, which resulted in an instability index of 57484.0 (where lower values would indicate better stability).

For my suggestion, I'll recommend increasing the cesium content while decreasing the formamidinium content, as cesium often contributes to better structural stability in perovskites:

**Suggested composition to test next:**
- CsPbI: 0.30
- FAPbI: 0.70
- MAPbI: 0.00

This adjustment increases the cesium content which may help improve the structural stability while maintaining a methylammonium-free composition, which is often beneficial for thermal stability.",456484,23707,Continuing

The first composition (CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0) showed a much lower instability index (57,484) compared to the second composition (CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16) which had a very high instability index (456,484).

This suggests that:
1. Higher FAPbI content appears beneficial for stability
2. The combination of CsPbI with FAPbI seems more stable than CsPbI with MAPbI

For the next composition to test, I recommend:

CsPbI: 0.10, FAPbI: 0.90, MAPbI: 0.00

This composition slightly reduces the CsPbI content and increases the FAPbI content compared to the first (more stable) composition, to see if further increasing the FAPbI ratio continues to improve stability.",293210,23707,Continuing

2. Cs₀.₈₄MA₀.₁₆Pb₁I₃ had instability indices of 456,484 and 293,210 (much higher/worse)

The composition with the highest FA content and lowest Cs content showed the best stability. This suggests that increasing FA content may be beneficial for stability in these systems.

I recommend testing:
**Cs₀.₁₀FA₀.₉₀Pb₁I₃** (CsPbI: 0.10, FAPbI: 0.90, MAPbI: 0.00)

This composition further increases the FA content while maintaining a small amount of Cs, which may help improve stability beyond what was observed in the best previous sample.",237318,23707,Continuing

3. CsPbI: 0.1, FAPbI: 0.9, MAPbI: 0.0 → Instability: 237,318

The composition with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 showed the lowest instability index. This suggests that:
- Moderate CsPbI with high FAPbI and no MAPbI performs well
- High CsPbI with some MAPbI and no FAPbI performs poorly

For the next test, I suggest:
CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0

However, there's an inconsistency in the data since this same composition appears again with a much higher instability index (286,689). This suggests either experimental variability or a reporting error.

The composition with CsPbI: 0.1, FAPbI: 0.9, MAPbI: 0.0 showed an instability index of 237,318, which is lower than most other reported values.

Based on these observations, I suggest testing:

**CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0**

2. The second lowest instability index (91,681) was observed with CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0
3. Compositions with higher CsPbI content (0.84) and some MAPbI (0.16) showed much higher instability indices

The trend suggests that:
- Compositions with moderate CsPbI content (0.16-0.2) and high FAPbI content (0.8-0.84) perform better
- Increasing the CsPbI content slightly from 0.16 to 0.2 while decreasing FAPbI from 0.84 to 0.8 showed promising results

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0

3. Compositions with higher MAPbI content (like CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.75) showed very high instability

The trend suggests that:
- Mixtures of CsPbI and FAPbI with no MAPbI perform better
- A CsPbI content around 0.16-0.2 with FAPbI seems optimal
- Increasing the CsPbI content slightly from 0.16 to 0.2 improved stability

Looking at the instability indices, I notice that compositions with CsPbI and FAPbI (without MAPbI) generally show lower instability indices compared to compositions containing MAPbI. The lowest instability index (57,484) was observed with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0, but this appears to be an outlier as the same composition showed a much higher value (286,689) in a later experiment.

The second-best stability was observed with CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0 (instability index: 91,681), followed by CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0 (instability index: 144,074).

This suggests a trend where increasing the CsPbI content from 0.16 to 0.25 (while keeping MAPbI at 0) shows promising stability improvements. I would recommend testing:

CsPbI: 0.3, FAPbI: 0.7, MAPbI: 0.0

Looking at the instability indices, I notice that compositions with higher CsPbI and FAPbI content, with little to no MAPbI, tend to have lower instability indices (which is desirable). The most stable composition tested so far is:

CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0, with an instability index of 57484

- CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0 (144074)

This suggests that a composition with CsPbI in the range of 0.16-0.25 and FAPbI in the range of 0.75-0.84, with no MAPbI, might be optimal.

For the next test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.0

This composition falls between the two most stable formulations observed so far and could help narrow down the optimal ratio between CsPbI and FAPbI for maximum stability.",27122,23707,Continuing

I observe that increasing the CsPbI content from 0.16 to 0.18 while keeping MAPbI at 0 significantly improved stability. The trend suggests that there might be an optimal ratio between CsPbI and FAPbI.

For the next composition to test, I recommend:

I recommend testing the following composition to further explore this promising region:

CsPbI: 0.19, FAPbI: 0.81, MAPbI: 0.0

This suggestion is based on the observation that the most stable compositions appear to be in the range of CsPbI between 0.16-0.20 combined with FAPbI, with the optimal point potentially around 0.18-0.19 for CsPbI. By testing CsPbI at 0.19, we can determine if the stability continues to improve in this narrow range or if 0.18 represents a local minimum for the instability index.",221696,23707,Continuing

- Slightly adjusts the FAPbI to 0.81 (between the two best performing compositions)
