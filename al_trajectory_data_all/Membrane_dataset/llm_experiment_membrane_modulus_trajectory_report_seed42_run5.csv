Based on the single data point provided (Experiment ID 12), I'll recommend parameters that are likely to increase the elastic modulus for your next membrane synthesis experiment.

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment:

- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Solution**: 18% polysulfone in PolarClean solvent (increased concentration)
- **Solution Preparation**: 
  - Automatically mixed by robotic system (Mixed: Yes)
  - Apply heating during mixing (Heating: Yes)
  - Heating block temperature: 60°C
  - Solution rest time: 1 day

## Casting Conditions:
- **Environmental Conditions**: 30% relative humidity
- **Casting Process**:
  - Automated blade casting
  - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time: 2 minutes
  - Apply nitrogen flow after blade casting (Nitrogen (After blade): Yes)
  - No nitrogen flow from side during drop (Nitrogen (Side from drop): No)

## Rationale:
1. **Higher polymer concentration** (18% vs 10%) should increase mechanical strength and modulus
2. **Heating during mixing** will improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement
3. **Lower humidity** (30% vs 56%) may slow the initial phase separation, leading to denser membrane structure
4. **Short wait time before immersion** (2 min) allows for controlled initial skin formation
5. **Nitrogen flow after blade casting** helps create a more uniform initial skin layer

These parameters aim to create a denser, more mechanically robust membrane structure with higher elastic modulus compared to the previous experiment.",65.48719407925006,296.35081017123304,Continuing
2,36,Index: 7; Auto: True; Heating: False; Concentration: 14.43; Heating Block Temperature: 25; Mixed: True; Rest Time (days): 4; Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0; Relative Humidity: 59; Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0; Nitrogen (After blade): 0,"Based on the two experimental reports provided, I'll analyze the parameters that appear to influence the elastic modulus and recommend the next experiment to maximize this property.

## Analysis of Current Data:
- Experiment #12: 10.0% polysulfone, no heating, 2 days rest, 56% RH, 0 min wait time, no nitrogen flow → Modulus: 39.59 bar
- Experiment #18: 13.0% polysulfone, heating at 50°C, 1 day rest, 96% RH, 0 min wait time, no nitrogen flow → Modulus: 65.49 bar

The higher modulus in Experiment #18 suggests that increased polymer concentration, heating during mixing, and higher humidity may positively impact the modulus.

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 15.0% (increasing from 13.0% to further explore the effect of higher concentration)
- **Heating**: Yes
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C (slightly higher than previous experiment)
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (maintained from successful Experiment #18)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (maintained from both experiments)
- **Relative Humidity**: 95% (maintaining the high humidity that appeared beneficial)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This experiment builds on the successful parameters from Experiment #18 while exploring a higher polymer concentration and heating temperature, which may further enhance the elastic modulus of the resulting membrane.",120.1628705347832,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three prior experiments, I can identify trends that suggest how to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Analysis of Prior Results:
- Experiment 7: 14.43% concentration, no heating, 4 days rest → 120.16 bar modulus (highest)
- Experiment 18: 13.0% concentration, heating at 50°C, 1 day rest → 65.49 bar modulus
- Experiment 12: 10.0% concentration, no heating, 2 days rest → 39.59 bar modulus (lowest)

## Key Observations:
1. Higher polymer concentration correlates with higher modulus
2. Longer rest time appears beneficial
3. No heating seems to produce better results than heating at 50°C
4. Humidity may play a role (59% for highest modulus vs. 96% for medium modulus)

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Concentration**: 16% (increasing from the best result of 14.43%)
- **Heating**: No (maintain ambient temperature of 25°C)
- **Mixed**: Yes (automatically mixed by robotic system)
- **Rest time**: 5 days (slightly longer than the best result)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (consistent with all prior experiments)
- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (similar to the best result)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This experiment pushes the concentration higher while maintaining the other conditions that produced the highest modulus, with a slightly extended rest time to potentially further improve polymer chain entanglement and resulting mechanical properties.",178.97379271834268,296.35081017123304,Continuing

1. Higher polymer concentration correlates with higher modulus:
   - 10.0% → 39.59 bar
   - 13.0% → 65.49 bar
   - 14.43% → 120.16 bar
   - 17.0% → 178.97 bar

2. Longer rest time (4 days) appears beneficial compared to shorter rest times (1-2 days)

3. Humidity shows mixed effects, but the highest modulus was achieved at 59% RH

4. No heating during mixing was used in the experiments with higher modulus values

## Recommended Next Experiment

- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (similar to the conditions that produced highest modulus)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This experiment pushes the polymer concentration to the upper limit of the typical range while maintaining the other conditions that appeared favorable in the previous high-modulus experiments.

Based on the previous experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus of the membranes:

1. **Polymer concentration** shows a strong positive correlation with modulus:
   - 10.0% concentration → 39.59 bar and 95.59 bar
   - 13.0% concentration → 65.49 bar
   - 14.43% concentration → 120.16 bar
   - 17.0% concentration → 178.97 bar (highest modulus observed)

2. **Rest time** of 4 days appears optimal in the highest-performing experiments.

3. **Relative humidity** around 59% seems to yield better results than very high (96%) or lower humidity.

4. **No heating** during mixing was used in the highest-performing experiments.

Based on the previous experimental data, I can identify several trends that correlate with higher elastic modulus values:

1. Higher polymer concentration (17.0%) consistently yields higher modulus values
2. The highest modulus (272.22 bar) was achieved with:
   - Extended wait time before bath immersion (10 minutes)
   - Nitrogen flow after blade casting
   - No rest time for the solution
   - Higher polymer concentration (17.0%)

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 60%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No

2. **No heating**: None of the highest-performing experiments used heating during mixing.

3. **Premixed solution**: The experiments with the highest modulus values (272.22, 219.62, 197.84 bar) all used premixed solutions.

4. **Zero rest time**: The top-performing experiments all used solutions with no rest period (0 days).

7. **Moderate humidity (60%)**: The best results occurred in the 58-70% humidity range.
