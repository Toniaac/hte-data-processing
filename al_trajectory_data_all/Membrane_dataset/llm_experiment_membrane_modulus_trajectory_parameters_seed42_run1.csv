# Recommended Next Experiment

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Auto | True | Maintain automation for consistency |
| Heating | True | Introduce heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement |
| Concentration | 15.0 | Increase polymer concentration as higher concentrations typically yield higher mechanical strength |
| Heating Block Temperature | 40 | Moderate heating to enhance polymer dissolution without degradation |
| Mixed | True | Continue with robot mixing for reproducibility |
| Rest Time (days) | 1 | Reduce rest time to minimize potential polymer aggregation |
| Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min) | 2.0 | Introduce a short delay to allow for controlled surface film formation |
| Relative Humidity | 40 | Lower humidity to reduce water vapor absorption during casting |
| Nitrogen (Side from drop) | 1 | Introduce nitrogen flow to create more controlled atmosphere |
| Nitrogen (After blade) | 1 | Add nitrogen after blade to promote more uniform solvent evaporation |

The high standard deviation in your current result (39.76 bar) suggests significant variability in the membrane structure. The proposed parameters aim to create more controlled conditions for phase separation, which should lead to more uniform pore structure and potentially higher modulus values.",110.69482106635698,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior observations, I can see that the second experiment (Index 77) produced a significantly higher modulus (110.69 bar) compared to the first experiment (39.59 bar). The key differences that likely contributed to this improvement were:

1. **Heating**: Changed from False to True
2. **Concentration**: Increased from 10.0% to 15.0%
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Increased from 25°C to 80°C
4. **Relative Humidity**: Slightly higher (58% vs 56%)

For the next experiment, I recommend:

## Recommended Parameters:
- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process)
- **Heating**: True (maintain heating which showed benefit)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increase further as higher concentration improved modulus)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 85°C (slightly increase from previous successful experiment)
- **Mixed**: True (maintain robot mixing)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 2 (maintain consistent rest time)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0 (maintain zero wait time)
- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (slight increase)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain no nitrogen flow)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain no nitrogen flow)

This recommendation builds on the successful parameters from experiment 77 while making strategic increases to concentration and heating temperature, which appear to positively influence the elastic modulus based on the observed trend.",189.441220061326,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Concentration**: Higher polymer concentration (17.0% > 15.0% > 10.0%) correlates with higher modulus values (189.44 > 110.69 > 39.59 bar)
2. **Heating**: Experiments with heating (True) showed significantly higher modulus values than without heating
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Higher temperature (80°C) appears beneficial
4. **Mixed**: The highest modulus was achieved with Mixed = False (pre-mixed solution)

For the next experiment, I recommend:

## Recommended Parameters:
- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process)
- **Heating**: True (beneficial for modulus)

- **Relative Humidity**: 58% (consistent with higher modulus experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain consistency)

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Higher concentration** (17%) tends to yield higher modulus values (189.44 and 172.07 bar)
2. **Heating** appears beneficial (experiments with heating generally show higher modulus)
3. **Manual premixing** (Mixed: False) seems to produce better results when combined with higher concentration
4. **Higher heating block temperature** (80°C) produced the highest modulus value
5. **Rest time** of 2 days appears slightly better than 1 day

## Key Observations:
- Higher polymer concentration (17%) generally yields higher modulus values
- Longer coupon-to-bath wait times (10 min) with nitrogen after blade shows excellent results
- No heating appears preferable for maximizing modulus
- Relative humidity around 50-60% seems optimal

1. The highest modulus value (277.39 bar) was achieved with experiment #68, which used:
   - Higher concentration (17.0%)
   - No heating
   - No mixing
   - No rest time
   - Immediate bath immersion (0.0 min)
   - Lower relative humidity (50%)
   - No nitrogen flow

2. Other high-performing experiments (>200 bar) share several common features:
   - Higher polymer concentration (17.0%)
   - No heating during preparation
   - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time of either 0.0 or 10.0 minutes
   - Nitrogen after blade in some cases
