# Recommended Next Experiment

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Auto | True | Maintain automation for consistency |
| Heating | True | Try heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement |
| Concentration | 15.0 | Increase polymer concentration as higher concentrations typically yield higher modulus |
| Heating Block Temperature | 40 | Moderate heating to enhance polymer dissolution without degradation |
| Mixed | True | Continue with robot mixing for reproducibility |
| Rest Time (days) | 1 | Reduce rest time to minimize potential polymer aggregation |
| Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min) | 2.0 | Introduce slight delay to allow for controlled surface film formation |
| Relative Humidity | 40 | Lower humidity to reduce water vapor absorption during casting |
| Nitrogen (Side from drop) | 1 | Add nitrogen flow to create more controlled atmosphere during casting |
| Nitrogen (After blade) | 1 | Add nitrogen flow after blade to promote more uniform solvent evaporation |

The high standard deviation in your current result (39.76 bar) suggests significant variability in the membrane structure. The proposed parameters aim to create more controlled conditions that should lead to more uniform membrane formation and potentially higher modulus values.",110.69482106635698,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior observations, I can see that the second experiment (Index 77) produced a significantly higher modulus (110.69 bar) compared to the first experiment (39.59 bar). The key differences that likely contributed to this improvement were:

1. **Heating**: Changed from False to True
2. **Concentration**: Increased from 10.0% to 15.0%
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Increased from 25°C to 80°C
4. **Relative Humidity**: Slightly higher (58% vs 56%)

For the next experiment, I recommend building on these findings by further optimizing these parameters:

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters:
- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process)
- **Heating**: True (maintain heating which showed benefit)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increase further as higher concentration improved modulus)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 85°C (slightly increase from previous successful experiment)
- **Mixed**: True (maintain robot mixing)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 3 (slightly increase to allow better polymer chain organization)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.5 (introduce slight delay to allow better surface structure formation)
- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (slightly increase as trend shows benefit)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain current setting)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain current setting)

This recommendation aims to further enhance modulus by increasing polymer concentration, optimizing thermal conditions, and allowing slightly more time for polymer organization before phase separation.",189.441220061326,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Concentration**: Higher polymer concentration (17.0% > 15.0% > 10.0%) correlates with higher modulus values (189.44 > 110.69 > 39.59 bar)
2. **Heating**: Experiments with heating (True) showed significantly higher modulus values than without heating
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Higher temperature (80°C) appears beneficial
4. **Mixed**: The highest modulus was achieved with Mixed = False (pre-mixed solution)

For the next experiment, I recommend:

## Recommended Parameters:

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Higher concentration** (17%) tends to yield higher modulus values (189.44 and 172.07 bar)
2. **Heating** appears beneficial (experiments with heating generally show higher modulus)
3. **Manual premixing** (Mixed: False) seems to produce better results when combined with higher concentration

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Higher concentration (17%)** consistently yields higher modulus values
2. **Heating** appears beneficial in most cases
3. **Non-mixed** solutions (False for Mixed parameter) generally perform better
4. The highest modulus (272.22 bar) was achieved with a **longer coupon-to-bath wait time (10 min)** and **nitrogen after blade**
5. **Rest time** of 0 days was present in the best-performing experiment

For the next experiment, I recommend the following parameters to maximize elastic modulus:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Auto | True |
| Heating | True |
| Concentration | 20.0 |
| Heating Block Temperature | 80 |
| Mixed | False |

| Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min) | 10.0 |
| Relative Humidity | 58 |
| Nitrogen (Side from drop) | 0 |
| Nitrogen (After blade) | 1 |

This recommendation:
- Pushes concentration to the upper end of the range (20%)
- Maintains heating at a high temperature (80°C)
- Uses non-mixed solution preparation
- Eliminates rest time (0 days)
- Maximizes coupon-to-bath wait time (10 min)

- **Heating Block Temperature**: 25
- **Mixed**: False
- **Rest Time (days)**: 0
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.17
- **Relative Humidity**: 70
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 1

## Rationale:

1. **Concentration**: The data shows a clear trend that higher polymer concentrations (17%) consistently yield higher modulus values. The top-performing experiments all used 17% concentration, so pushing to 20% may further improve results.

2. **Heating & Mixing**: Non-heated, non-mixed solutions generally performed better for modulus.

3. **Wait Time**: A very short coupon-to-bath wait time (0.17 min) combined with nitrogen after blade showed excellent results in experiment #50.

4. **Humidity**: A relatively high humidity (70%) appears beneficial when combined with the other parameters.

5. **Nitrogen**: Using nitrogen after blade (value = 1) but not from the side (value = 0) appears in several high-performing experiments.

This recommendation builds on the successful parameters from experiment #68 (highest modulus) while incorporating insights from other high-performing experiments.",270.69323356331364,296.35081017123304,Continuing
32,57,Index: 53; Auto: True; Heating: False; Concentration: 17.0; Heating Block Temperature: 25; Mixed: False; Rest Time (days): 0; Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 10.0; Relative Humidity: 68; Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0; Nitrogen (After blade): 0,"Based on analyzing the provided experimental data, I can identify patterns that correlate with higher elastic modulus values. The highest modulus values observed are:

1. Index 68: 277.39 bar (17% concentration, no heating, no mixing, 0 rest days, 0.17 min wait time, 70% RH, nitrogen after blade)
2. Index 56: 272.22 bar (17% concentration, no heating, no mixing, 0 rest days, 10 min wait time, 58% RH, nitrogen after blade)
3. Index 19: 270.69 bar (17% concentration, with heating at 50°C, no mixing, 1 rest day, 0 min wait time, 96% RH, no nitrogen)

For the next experiment to maximize modulus, I recommend:

**Recommended Parameters:**
- Auto: True
- Heating: False
- Concentration: 20.0 (increasing to maximum in range)
- Heating Block Temperature: 25
- Mixed: False
- Rest Time (days): 0
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 5.0
- Relative Humidity: 70
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0
- Nitrogen (After blade): 1

**Rationale:**
- Higher polymer concentration (17-20%) consistently produces higher modulus
- Non-mixed solutions generally perform better than mixed ones
- No heating appears optimal for most high-modulus results
- Moderate to high relative humidity (60-70%) correlates with better performance
- Nitrogen after blade appears beneficial
- A moderate coupon-to-bath wait time (5 min) balances between immediate immersion and longer delays
- Zero rest days appears optimal for most high-performing membranes

This parameter set builds on the successful conditions from experiments that yielded the highest modulus values while pushing the concentration to the upper limit of the range.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
