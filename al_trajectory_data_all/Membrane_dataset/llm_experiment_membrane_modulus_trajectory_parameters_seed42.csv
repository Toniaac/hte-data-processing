# Recommended Next Experiment

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Auto | True | Maintain automation for consistency |
| Heating | True | Try heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement |
| Concentration | 15.0 | Increase polymer concentration as higher concentrations typically yield higher modulus |
| Heating Block Temperature | 40 | Moderate heating to enhance polymer dissolution without degradation |
| Mixed | True | Maintain robot mixing for consistency |
| Rest Time (days) | 1 | Reduce rest time to minimize potential polymer aggregation |
| Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min) | 2.0 | Introduce short delay to allow partial solvent evaporation, potentially increasing surface density |
| Relative Humidity | 40 | Lower humidity to promote faster solvent evaporation at surface |
| Nitrogen (Side from drop) | 0 | Maintain current setting |
| Nitrogen (After blade) | 1 | Add nitrogen flow after blade to promote more uniform solvent evaporation |

Based on the two prior observations, I can see that the second experiment (Index 77) produced a significantly higher modulus (110.69 bar) compared to the first experiment (39.59 bar). The key differences that likely contributed to this improvement were:

1. **Heating**: Changed from False to True
2. **Concentration**: Increased from 10.0% to 15.0%
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Increased from 25°C to 80°C
4. **Relative Humidity**: Slightly higher (58% vs 56%)

For the next experiment, I recommend building on these findings by further optimizing these parameters:

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters:
- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process)
- **Heating**: True (maintain heating which showed benefit)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increase further as higher concentration improved modulus)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 85°C (slightly increase from previous successful experiment)
- **Mixed**: True (maintain robot mixing)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 2 (maintain consistent with previous experiments)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0 (maintain consistent with previous experiments)
- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (slight increase as trend suggests benefit)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain consistent with previous experiments)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain consistent with previous experiments)

This recommendation aims to further increase polymer concentration and slightly increase heating temperature, which appear to be the most significant factors contributing to higher modulus based on the available data.",189.441220061326,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Concentration**: There's a clear positive correlation between polymer concentration and modulus (10% → 39.59 bar, 15% → 110.69 bar, 17% → 189.44 bar)
2. **Heating**: Experiments with heating (True) showed significantly higher modulus values
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Higher temperature (80°C) correlates with higher modulus
4. **Mixed**: The highest modulus was achieved with Mixed = False

For the next experiment, I recommend:

## Recommended Parameters:
- **Auto**: True
- **Heating**: True
- **Concentration**: 20.0% (increasing to the upper limit of typical range)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 80°C (maintaining the successful high temperature)
- **Mixed**: False (following the best result)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 2 (consistent with previous successful experiments)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0 (consistent with previous experiments)
- **Relative Humidity**: 58% (maintaining the condition from successful experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (No)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (No)

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus of the membranes:

1. **Higher polymer concentration** (17%) consistently yields higher modulus values (178-189 bar) compared to lower concentrations (10-15%)
2. **Heating** appears beneficial when combined with higher concentrations
3. **Manual premixing** (Mixed: False) seems to produce better results at higher concentrations

1. **Concentration**: Higher polymer concentrations (17%) generally yield higher modulus values (189.44, 179.24, 178.97 bar) compared to lower concentrations (10%).

2. **Heating**: Experiment #78 with heating (80°C) and 17% concentration produced the highest modulus (189.44 bar).

3. **Mixed vs. Premixed**: For high concentration (17%), non-mixed solutions (premixed) appear to perform better.

4. **Rest Time**: 2-4 days of rest time seems optimal for high modulus values.

5. **Relative Humidity**: The best results were observed around 58-59% RH.
