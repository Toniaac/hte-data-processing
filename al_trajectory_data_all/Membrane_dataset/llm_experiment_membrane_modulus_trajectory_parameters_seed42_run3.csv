# Recommended Next Experiment

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Auto | True | Maintain automation for consistency |
| Heating | True | Try heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement |
| Concentration | 15.0 | Increase polymer concentration as higher concentrations typically yield higher modulus |
| Heating Block Temperature | 40 | Moderate heating to enhance polymer dissolution without degradation |
| Mixed | True | Maintain robot mixing for homogeneity |
| Rest Time (days) | 1 | Reduce rest time to minimize potential polymer aggregation |
| Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min) | 2.0 | Introduce slight delay to allow for controlled surface film formation |
| Relative Humidity | 40 | Lower humidity to reduce water vapor absorption during casting |
| Nitrogen (Side from drop) | 1 | Add nitrogen flow to create more controlled atmosphere |
| Nitrogen (After blade) | 1 | Add nitrogen flow after blade to promote more uniform solvent evaporation |

The high standard deviation in your current result (39.76 bar) suggests significant variability in the membrane properties. The proposed changes aim to create more controlled conditions and increase polymer concentration, which should lead to a denser polymer network and potentially higher modulus with better consistency.",110.69482106635698,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior observations, I can see that the second experiment (Index 77) produced a significantly higher modulus (110.69 bar) compared to the first experiment (39.59 bar). The key differences that likely contributed to this improvement were:

1. **Heating**: Changed from False to True
2. **Concentration**: Increased from 10.0% to 15.0%
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Increased from 25°C to 80°C
4. **Relative Humidity**: Slightly higher (58% vs 56%)

For the next experiment, I recommend building on these findings by further optimizing these parameters:

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters:
- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process)
- **Heating**: True (maintain heating which showed benefit)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increase further as higher concentration improved modulus)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 85°C (slightly increase from previous successful experiment)
- **Mixed**: True (maintain robot mixing)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 3 (slightly increase to allow better polymer chain organization)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.5 (introduce slight delay to allow more controlled phase separation)
- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (slightly increase as trend shows benefit)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain current setting)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain current setting)

## Analysis of Current Data

Looking at the highest modulus values:
- Experiment Index 68: Modulus = 277.39 bar (highest)
- Experiment Index 55: Modulus = 219.62 bar (second highest)
- Experiment Index 78: Modulus = 189.44 bar

Key patterns observed:

2. No heating or lower heating block temperature often yields better results
3. Non-mixed solutions (Mixed: False) tend to perform better

Based on the provided experimental data, I've analyzed the relationships between various parameters and the elastic modulus. Here's my recommendation for the next experiment to maximize modulus:

## Recommended Experimental Parameters:

- **Auto**: True
- **Heating**: False
- **Concentration**: 20.0% (increasing to maximum in range)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 25°C
- **Mixed**: False

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0
- **Relative Humidity**: 50%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (No)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (No)

## Rationale:

1. **Concentration**: The highest modulus values (189.44, 179.24, 178.97, 219.62, 277.39 bar) are generally associated with higher polymer concentrations. Experiment #68 with 17% concentration yielded 277.39 bar, suggesting that increasing to 20% may further improve modulus.

2. **Heating**: The data suggests that non-heated solutions (Heating: False) generally produce higher modulus values.

3. **Mixed**: Unmixed solutions (Mixed: False) appear to yield higher modulus values when combined with higher concentrations.

4. **Rest Time**: Longer rest times (4 days) correlate with higher modulus values in several experiments.

5. **Relative Humidity**: Lower humidity (50%) appears optimal, as seen in experiments #68 and #69 which produced the highest modulus values.

6. **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: Immediate immersion (0.0 min) consistently yields better results than delayed immersion.

7. **Nitrogen Flow**: The absence of nitrogen flow appears to be preferable for maximizing modulus.

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0
- **Relative Humidity**: 45 (lower humidity appears beneficial)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0

## Rationale:

1. **Concentration**: The highest modulus values consistently appear with higher polymer concentrations (17%). Increasing to 18% may further improve mechanical properties.

## Key Observations:
1. Higher concentration (17%) generally yields higher modulus values
2. Lower relative humidity (around 50%) appears beneficial

## Rationale:
- Increased concentration to 20% (maximum in range) as higher concentrations consistently show better results
- Maintained no heating as top performers didn't use heating
- Selected unmixed condition as this appears in many high-modulus results
- Extended rest time to 4 days which showed good results in experiments #4 and #8
- Reduced relative humidity further to 45% as lower humidity correlates with higher modulus
- Added nitrogen flow from the side during drop which showed benefit in experiment #45
- Maintained immediate bath immersion (0.0 min wait time) which is consistent across high performers

Based on the provided experimental data, I've analyzed the patterns that lead to higher elastic modulus values. The highest modulus observed was 277.39 bar (Index 68), followed by 270.69 bar (Index 5) and 242.92 bar (Index 40).

## Key Observations:
1. Lower relative humidity (around 50%) tends to produce higher modulus values
2. Concentration of 17% generally yields better results than lower concentrations
3. Zero coupon-to-bath wait time is associated with higher modulus in most cases
4. Nitrogen flow from the side appears beneficial in several high-modulus cases
5. No heating generally performs better than heating

## Recommended Next Experimental Parameters:

- **Auto**: True
- **Heating**: False
- **Concentration**: 20.0 (pushing to the upper limit of the range)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 25
- **Mixed**: False
- **Rest Time (days)**: 0
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0
- **Relative Humidity**: 45 (pushing slightly lower than previous best)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 1
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0

This combination builds on the successful parameters from experiments with high modulus values while strategically pushing concentration higher and humidity lower to potentially achieve even better mechanical properties.",242.41091008794928,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I've analyzed the patterns that lead to higher elastic modulus values. The highest observed modulus was 277.39 bar (Index 68), followed by 270.69 bar (Index 5) and 242.92 bar (Index 52).

## Recommended Experimental Parameters:

- **Index**: Next available number
- **Auto**: True
- **Heating**: False
- **Concentration**: 17.0%
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 25°C
- **Mixed**: False
- **Rest Time (days)**: 0
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0
- **Relative Humidity**: 45%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 1
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0

## Rationale:

1. **Concentration**: Higher polymer concentrations (17%) consistently produced higher modulus values.
2. **Relative Humidity**: Lower humidity (45-50%) appears to favor higher modulus.
3. **Nitrogen flow from side**: This parameter showed positive effects in several high-modulus experiments.
4. **No heating**: The highest modulus values were achieved without heating.
5. **No mixing**: Unmixed solutions generally performed better for high concentration polymers.
6. **Zero wait time**: Immediate immersion in the non-solvent bath appears optimal.
7. **Fresh solution**: 0 days rest time has produced excellent results in several experiments.

This recommendation combines the most promising parameters observed in the highest-performing experiments while slightly pushing the relative humidity lower than previous tests to explore if further improvements can be achieved.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
