Since we have limited data, I'll make an educated recommendation based on polymer membrane science principles:

Recommended next experiment:

- Index: 22
- Auto: True
- Heating: True (changing from False to True to potentially improve polymer dissolution)
- Concentration: 15.0 (increasing from 12.0 as higher polymer concentration often yields higher modulus)
- Heating Block Temperature: 40 (increasing from 25 to enhance polymer dissolution)
- Mixed: True
- Rest Time (days): 2 (increasing from 1 to allow better polymer chain relaxation)
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 1.0 (increasing slightly to allow more solvent evaporation)
- Relative Humidity: 35 (decreasing from 49 to potentially create a denser skin layer)
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0
- Nitrogen (After blade): 1 (adding nitrogen flow after blade to promote controlled evaporation)

This recommendation aims to increase modulus by:
1) Increasing polymer concentration which typically correlates with higher mechanical strength
2) Improving polymer dissolution through heating
3) Allowing longer polymer relaxation time
4) Creating conditions for a denser membrane structure through controlled evaporation and humidity",88.47667256854467,296.35081017123304,Continuing
2,40,Index: 23; Auto: True; Heating: False; Concentration: 16.0; Heating Block Temperature: 25; Mixed: True; Rest Time (days): 1; Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0; Relative Humidity: 49; Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0; Nitrogen (After blade): 0,"Based on the two observations provided, I can see that increasing the polymer concentration from 12.0% to 14.0% resulted in a significant improvement in elastic modulus (from 42.74 to 88.48 bar). This suggests that higher polymer concentration leads to stronger membranes, which is consistent with polymer science principles where increased polymer content typically enhances mechanical properties.

For the next experiment to maximize modulus, I recommend:

Parameters:
- Index: 23 (next in sequence)
- Auto: True (maintain automated process for consistency)
- Heating: False (maintain as in previous experiments)
- Concentration: 16.0 (increase concentration further to explore upper range)
- Heating Block Temperature: 25 (maintain as in previous experiments)
- Mixed: True (maintain robot mixing for consistency)
- Rest Time (days): 1 (maintain as in previous experiments)
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0 (maintain as in previous experiments)
- Relative Humidity: 49 (maintain as in previous experiments)
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0 (maintain as in previous experiments)
- Nitrogen (After blade): 0 (maintain as in previous experiments)

This experiment maintains all parameters constant except for concentration, which I've increased to 16.0% to continue exploring the trend of improved modulus with higher polymer content. If this trend continues, we should see an even higher elastic modulus value.",162.77817832797786,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I observe a clear trend where increasing polymer concentration correlates strongly with higher elastic modulus values:

- 12.0% concentration → 42.74 bar modulus
- 14.0% concentration → 88.48 bar modulus
- 16.0% concentration → 162.78 bar modulus

This shows a non-linear increase in modulus with concentration, suggesting we should continue exploring higher concentration values.

- Index: 24
- Auto: True
- Heating: False
- Concentration: 18.0
- Heating Block Temperature: 25
- Mixed: True
- Rest Time (days): 1
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0
- Relative Humidity: 49
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0
- Nitrogen (After blade): 0

## Rationale:
The data shows that increasing polymer concentration from 12% to 16% dramatically improved the elastic modulus from 42.74 to 162.78 bar. The relationship appears to be potentially exponential, suggesting further gains at 18% concentration. All other parameters should be kept constant to isolate the effect of concentration and confirm this trend.",141.45379911190125,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that suggest how to maximize the elastic modulus:

1. **Concentration effect**: There's a clear positive correlation between polymer concentration and modulus:
   - 12% concentration → 42.74 bar
   - 14% concentration → 88.48 bar
   - 16% concentration → 162.78 bar

2. **Environmental conditions**: Experiment #25 shows that higher relative humidity (80% vs 49%) and nitrogen flow from the side significantly improved modulus for 12% concentration (141.45 bar vs 42.74 bar).

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters:

- **Index**: 26 (next in sequence)
- **Auto**: True
- **Heating**: False
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from 16% to continue the positive trend)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 25

- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0

This experiment combines the highest polymer concentration with the environmental conditions that showed positive effects on modulus, which should theoretically yield the highest modulus value yet.",42.124759091300646,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that suggest how to maximize the elastic modulus:

1. **Concentration**: There's a clear positive correlation between polymer concentration and modulus:
   - 12% concentration → ~42 bar modulus
   - 14% concentration → ~88 bar modulus
   - 16% concentration → ~163 bar modulus

2. **Relative Humidity**: Higher humidity (80%) combined with nitrogen flow from the side produced a high modulus (141.45 bar) even at lower concentration (12%).

3. **Rest Time**: The experiment with 0 days rest time showed lower modulus compared to 1 day rest time at similar conditions.

## Recommended Next Experiment:

I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment:

- **Index**: Next available number
- **Auto**: True
- **Heating**: False
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from the highest tested value of 16%)

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.0
- **Relative Humidity**: 80

- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0

## Rationale:
This experiment combines the highest polymer concentration (which showed a strong positive correlation with modulus) with the high humidity and nitrogen flow conditions that also produced good results. The 1-day rest time is maintained as it appears to be beneficial compared to 0 days. This combination of parameters should maximize the elastic modulus based on the observed trends in the data.",147.00005295683096,296.35081017123304,Continuing

2. **Relative Humidity**: Higher humidity appears beneficial (experiment #25 with 80% RH yielded 141.45 bar)

3. **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Using nitrogen flow from the side appears to improve modulus (experiment #28 with 54% RH yielded 147.0 bar)

4. **Rest Time**: 1 day rest time generally produced better results than 0 days

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Concentration**: Higher polymer concentration (16%) consistently yields higher modulus values compared to lower concentrations (12%, 14%)
2. **Relative Humidity**: Higher humidity appears beneficial (experiments with RH 54-80% show better results)
3. **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Using nitrogen flow from the side (value=1) generally improves modulus
4. **Rest Time**: 1 day rest time appears more effective than 0 days

The highest modulus achieved so far is 220.51 bar (Experiment #30) with the following parameters:
- Concentration: 16.0%
- Relative Humidity: 54%
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 1
- Rest Time: 1 day

## Next Experiment Recommendation:

I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment:

- Auto: True
- Heating: False
- Concentration: 18.0% (increasing from the best result of 16%)
- Heating Block Temperature: 25
- Mixed: True
- Rest Time (days): 1
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 0.0
- Relative Humidity: 70% (optimizing between the successful values of 54% and 80%)
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 1
- Nitrogen (After blade): 0

This combination builds upon the most successful experiment (#30) by further increasing the polymer concentration to 18% (within the typical 10-20% range) and optimizing the relative humidity to 70%, which falls between values that have shown good results. The other parameters are maintained at their optimal observed values.",211.5086541241532,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that influence the elastic modulus:

1. **Concentration**: Higher polymer concentration (16-17%) consistently yields higher modulus values
2. **Relative Humidity**: Higher humidity (54-80%) appears beneficial
3. **Nitrogen flow**: Using nitrogen (either side from drop or after blade) shows positive effects
4. **Rest Time**: The data suggests 1 day rest time may be better than 0 days
5. **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: Longer wait time (10 min) appears in one of the highest modulus experiments

The highest modulus value (220.51 bar) was achieved with experiment #30, which used:
- 16% concentration
- 54% relative humidity
- Nitrogen from side during drop
- 1 day rest time

3. **Relative Humidity**: Higher humidity generally correlates with higher modulus values

4. **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: Longer wait time (10 min) combined with high concentration yielded excellent results

5. **Rest Time**: The data suggests 1 day rest time may be preferable to 0 days for higher modulus

The highest modulus value (220.51 bar) was achieved with experiment #54, which had:
- High concentration (17%)
- No heating
- Not mixed by robot (Mixed: False)
- No rest time
- 10-minute coupon-to-bath wait time
- High relative humidity (68%)
- Nitrogen after blade (not from side)
