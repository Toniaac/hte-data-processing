Since we have limited data, I'll make a strategic recommendation that explores a promising direction while staying within the parameter ranges.

Recommended next experiment:

- Index: 50
- Auto: True
- Heating: True (changing from False to explore if heating improves polymer chain alignment)
- Concentration: 19.0 (increasing concentration as higher polymer content often increases mechanical strength)
- Heating Block Temperature: 40 (moderate heating to improve polymer dissolution without degradation)
- Mixed: True (changing to explore if robot mixing improves homogeneity)
- Rest Time (days): 1 (adding rest time to allow better polymer chain relaxation)
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 5.0 (reducing to explore if less solvent evaporation affects structure)
- Relative Humidity: 70 (reducing from very high humidity to moderate)
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 1 (keeping this parameter constant)
- Nitrogen (After blade): 1 (changing to explore if additional nitrogen flow improves surface properties)

This experiment explores several parameter changes that could potentially increase modulus by improving polymer chain alignment, increasing polymer content, and creating more uniform membrane structure.",197.8404462303588,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior observations, I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment that are likely to maximize the elastic modulus.

## Analysis of Prior Results
- Experiment #49 yielded the higher modulus (228.31 bar) with high humidity (95%), longer wait time (10 min), and nitrogen from the side
- Experiment #50 yielded a lower modulus (197.84 bar) with moderate humidity (70%), very short wait time (0.17 min), and nitrogen after blade

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment

- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process for consistency)
- **Heating**: False (consistent with prior successful experiments)
- **Concentration**: 18.0 (slightly increase from 17.0 to potentially enhance polymer network strength)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 25 (maintain consistent temperature)
- **Mixed**: False (consistent with prior experiments)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 0 (consistent with prior experiments)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 10.0 (maintain the longer wait time that produced higher modulus)
- **Relative Humidity**: 95 (maintain the high humidity that produced higher modulus)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 1 (maintain this parameter from the higher-modulus experiment)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain this parameter from the higher-modulus experiment)

This recommendation builds on the parameters that produced the higher modulus while slightly increasing polymer concentration, which typically enhances mechanical properties in membrane synthesis.",159.30709474405634,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

1. Higher polymer concentration (17% vs 10%) significantly increases modulus
2. Higher relative humidity (95% vs 61-70%) correlates with higher modulus
3. Longer coupon-to-bath wait time (10 min vs 0-0.17 min) appears beneficial
4. Nitrogen flow from the side during drop casting may be advantageous
5. Manual premixing (Mixed: False) seems to yield better results than robot mixing

For the next experiment, I recommend the following parameters:

## Rationale:

1. **Concentration**: The data shows a clear trend that higher concentration (17% vs 10%) yields significantly higher modulus values. Experiments with 17% concentration consistently produced moduli above 150 bar, while 10% concentration experiments yielded much lower values (24-95 bar).

2. **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: Longer wait times (10 min) generally produced higher modulus values compared to shorter times, as seen in experiments #56, #55, and #54.

3. **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Using nitrogen after blade (value=1) appears beneficial, as evidenced by the highest modulus value (272.22 bar) in experiment #56.

4. **Relative Humidity**: The optimal range appears to be between 58-70%, with the highest modulus at 58% (experiment #56).

Based on the provided experimental data, I've analyzed the relationships between parameters and elastic modulus values to determine the optimal next experiment.

## Key Observations:
1. The highest modulus value (277.39 bar) was observed in experiment #68 with:
   - Concentration: 17.0%
   - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time: 0.0 min
   - Relative Humidity: 50%
   - No nitrogen flow options enabled

2. High modulus values (>200 bar) generally correlate with:

   - Longer coupon-to-bath wait times (10.0 min) in some cases
   - Varied relative humidity (50-95%)

3. Low modulus values (<100 bar) are associated with:
