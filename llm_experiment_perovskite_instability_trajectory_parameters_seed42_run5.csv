The current composition (CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0) shows a relatively high instability index of 57484. To improve stability, I'll recommend adjusting the ratio between cesium and formamidinium components.

Research suggests that increasing the cesium content can often enhance stability in perovskite compositions. Therefore, I recommend:

**Next composition to test:**
CsPbI: 0.30
FAPbI: 0.70
MAPbI: 0.00

This increases the cesium content while maintaining a zero methylammonium component. The higher cesium proportion may help improve the structural stability and reduce the instability index compared to the previous composition.",456484,23707,Continuing

The data shows:
- Composition 1: CsPbI (0.16), FAPbI (0.84), MAPbI (0.0) had an instability index of 57,484
- Composition 2: CsPbI (0.84), FAPbI (0.0), MAPbI (0.16) had a much higher instability index of 456,484

The first composition with higher FAPbI content showed significantly better stability (lower instability index). This suggests that increasing the FAPbI component while maintaining some CsPbI might be beneficial.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.25
FAPbI: 0.75
MAPbI: 0.0

This composition increases the CsPbI content slightly from the more stable composition while maintaining a high FAPbI content and keeping MAPbI at zero (since the composition with MAPbI showed much worse stability).",293210,23707,Continuing

2. Cs₀.₈₄MA₀.₁₆Pb₁I₃ had instability indices of 456,484 and 293,210 (much higher/worse)

The composition with the highest FA content and lowest Cs content showed the best stability. This suggests we should explore compositions with higher FA content while keeping some Cs for stabilization.

My recommendation for the next composition to test is:
**CsPbI: 0.10, FAPbI: 0.90, MAPbI: 0.00**

- CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16 → Instability: 293,210 and 456,484

The composition with the lowest instability index (best stability) is CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0. This suggests that:
1. A mixture of CsPbI and FAPbI performs better than compositions with MAPbI
2. Higher FAPbI content with some CsPbI appears beneficial
3. The optimal CsPbI content might be around 0.16-0.20

The data suggests that compositions with CsPbI around 0.16-0.2 and high FAPbI content perform better. Since CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0 showed good results, I recommend exploring slightly higher CsPbI content while maintaining zero or minimal MAPbI.

This composition is a slight modification of the most stable compositions observed so far, exploring the space between the two best performing formulations. It maintains the CsPbI content at 0.17 (which appears optimal), slightly increases the FAPbI content compared to the best performer, and slightly decreases the MAPbI content to find a potentially better balance.",228347,23707,Continuing
24,127,"CsPbI: 0.13, FAPbI: 0.79, MAPbI: 0.08, Instability index: 184086.0","Based on the experimental data provided, I notice that compositions with CsPbI around 0.17-0.18, FAPbI around 0.80-0.82, and small amounts of MAPbI (0.00-0.03) have shown some of the lowest instability indices.

The composition with the lowest instability index (26197) was:
CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.80, MAPbI: 0.03

The second lowest instability index (27122) was:
CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.00

The third lowest instability index (38370) was also:
CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.80, MAPbI: 0.03

For the next composition to test, I suggest:
CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.81, MAPbI: 0.02

This composition is within the promising region identified from your data, slightly adjusting the FAPbI content between the two best-performing compositions while maintaining a small amount of MAPbI that appears beneficial for stability.",184086,23707,Continuing

Looking at the data, I notice that the lowest instability indices were observed in these compositions:
- CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.0 (Instability index: 27122)
- CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03 (Instability index: 26197)
- CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03 (Instability index: 38370)

The most stable composition appears to be around CsPbI: 0.17-0.18, with high FAPbI content (0.8-0.82) and minimal MAPbI (0-0.03). Since the composition with CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03 showed the lowest instability index (26197), I would suggest exploring nearby compositions.

My recommendation for the next composition to test is:

CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.81, MAPbI: 0.02

This composition maintains the successful CsPbI content at 0.17, slightly increases the FAPbI content compared to the most stable composition, and includes a small amount of MAPbI, which seems beneficial based on the data.",24723,23707,Continuing

Looking at the data, I notice that the lowest instability indices (which indicate better stability) are:
- CsPbI: 0.13, FAPbI: 0.87, MAPbI: 0.0 (Instability index: 24723)
- CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03 (Instability index: 26197)
- CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.0 (Instability index: 27122)

These compositions suggest that:
1. A combination of mostly FAPbI with some CsPbI performs well
2. Low or zero MAPbI content seems beneficial
3. The CsPbI content around 0.13-0.18 appears promising

For the next test, I suggest exploring:

**Parameters: CsPbI: 0.15, FAPbI: 0.85, MAPbI: 0.0**

This composition is between the two best-performing samples with zero MAPbI content, which should help determine if there's an optimal CsPbI:FAPbI ratio in this range for maximum stability.",23707,23707,Min instability index reached
