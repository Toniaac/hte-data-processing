# Recommended Next Experiment

I recommend the following parameters for your next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

- **Concentration**: 15.0% polysulfone (increase from 12.0%)
- **Auto**: Yes (maintain automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: Yes (introduce heating during mixing)
- **Heating block temperature**: 40°C
- **Mixed**: Yes (use robot mixing)
- **Rest time**: 2 days (increase from 1 day)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2.0 minutes (increase from 0.0 minutes)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (decrease from 49%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (introduce nitrogen flow)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (introduce nitrogen flow)

## Rationale
1. **Increasing polymer concentration** (12% → 15%) should increase chain entanglement and likely improve mechanical properties including modulus
2. **Adding heating during mixing** will improve polymer dissolution and distribution
3. **Increasing rest time** (1 → 2 days) may allow better polymer relaxation and more uniform structure
4. **Adding a short wait time** before immersion could promote controlled initial skin formation
5. **Introducing nitrogen flow** can help control evaporation rate and humidity at the membrane surface
6. **Slightly lower humidity** may promote more favorable phase separation kinetics

This experiment represents a strategic step to explore conditions that should favor higher mechanical strength while staying within your parameter ranges.",88.47667256854467,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two experiments provided, I can observe that increasing the polymer concentration from 12.0% to 14.0% resulted in a significant improvement in elastic modulus (from 42.74 to 88.48 MPa). All other parameters remained constant between these experiments.

For the next experiment, I recommend:

## Proposed Experimental Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (room temperature mixing)
- **Concentration**: 16.0% (increasing from 14.0% to continue the trend)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (room temperature)
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest time**: 1 day (maintain consistency)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 min (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 49% (maintain consistency)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

## Rationale
The data shows a clear positive correlation between polymer concentration and elastic modulus. Increasing the concentration from 12.0% to 14.0% nearly doubled the modulus. Continuing this trend by testing a 16.0% concentration while keeping other parameters constant will help determine if this relationship continues and potentially achieve an even higher modulus. This approach follows the principle of changing one variable at a time to clearly understand its effect on the membrane properties.",162.77817832797786,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three experiments provided, I can observe a clear trend that increasing polymer concentration leads to significantly higher elastic modulus values:

- Experiment #21: 12.0% concentration → 42.74 MPa modulus
- Experiment #22: 14.0% concentration → 88.48 MPa modulus
- Experiment #23: 16.0% concentration → 162.78 MPa modulus

This suggests a strong positive correlation between polymer concentration and modulus, with the relationship potentially being non-linear (as the increase from 14% to 16% yielded a larger modulus improvement than from 12% to 14%).

## Recommended Next Experiment

I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize modulus:

- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (room temperature mixing)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from previous maximum of 16%)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (room temperature)
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest time**: 1 day (consistent with previous experiments)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 49% (consistent with previous experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This experiment maintains all parameters constant except for increasing the polymer concentration to 18%, which should continue the observed trend of increasing modulus with higher concentration, while staying within typical concentration ranges for membrane synthesis.",207.09310351510177,296.35081017123304,Continuing

   - 14.0% → 88.48 MPa
   - 16.0% → 162.78 MPa

2. **Nitrogen Flow**: Experiment #29 with nitrogen flow from the side during drop-casting showed significantly higher modulus (207.09 MPa) compared to experiment #22 (88.48 MPa) with identical concentration (14.0%).

3. **Relative Humidity**: A slight increase in humidity (from 49% to 54%) coincided with higher modulus in experiment #29.

2. Nitrogen flow during processing appears beneficial - experiments with nitrogen flow (#28, #29, #30, #50) consistently showed higher modulus values.

3. Higher humidity (around 70%) combined with nitrogen flow control appears to yield better results than lower humidity conditions.

4. Using premixed solutions without rest time showed good results in experiment #50 (197.84 MPa).

5. The short wait time (0.17 min) before bath immersion in experiment #50 produced excellent results compared to immediate immersion.

This parameter combination builds upon the successful conditions from experiment #50 while increasing concentration and adding nitrogen flow at both stages to potentially achieve even higher modulus values.",168.33383829683325,296.35081017123304,Continuing

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 58%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale:
1. **Polymer Concentration**: The data shows a clear trend that higher polymer concentration correlates with higher modulus (Exp #23 with 16% had 162.78 MPa, Exp #30 with 16% had 220.51 MPa, Exp #56 with 17% had 272.22 MPa). Increasing to 18% should further enhance modulus.

2. **Wait Time**: Experiment #56 with the highest modulus (272.22 MPa) used a 10-minute wait time, significantly longer than most other experiments. This extended evaporation time likely allows for better polymer chain organization.

3. **Nitrogen After Blade**: Applying nitrogen flow after blade casting appears beneficial for modulus (present in experiments #50, #51, and #56 with high modulus values).

4. **No Heating/Immediate Use/Premixed**: The highest modulus values were achieved with premixed solutions used immediately without heating.

5. **Relative Humidity**: Maintaining around 58% RH (as in Exp #56) appears optimal, as extremely high humidity (70%) didn't yield the highest modulus.

1. **Higher polymer concentration**: The data shows a clear trend where higher polymer concentrations (16-17%) produced higher modulus values. Experiment #56 with 17% concentration achieved the highest modulus (272.22).

2. **Extended wait time**: The 10-minute wait time before bath immersion in experiments #55 and #56 yielded significantly higher modulus values compared to immediate immersion or shorter wait times.

3. **Controlled humidity with post-blade nitrogen**: Applying nitrogen after blade casting appears beneficial, especially with longer wait times, as it controls humidity exposure during the critical pre-bath period.

4. **Moderate humidity**: The highest modulus was achieved at 58% RH (Exp #56), which appears optimal compared to both higher (68-70%) and lower (49-54%) humidity conditions.

5. **No heating and immediate use**: The best results came from unheated, premixed solutions used immediately without rest time.
