D1: 50.00%

- Slightly decreasing P3HT while increasing D1 may improve conductivity, as D1 appears to be an important component based on its high percentage in the successful formulation
- Maintaining small amounts of D2, D6, and D8 to preserve their potential beneficial effects
- The total adds up to 100% and all components remain within the specified ranges
