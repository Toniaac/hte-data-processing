# Recommended Next Experiment

## Experiment Parameters:

- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Solution**: 19.0% polysulfone in PolarClean solvent (increased concentration)
- **Solution Preparation**: With heating (Heating: Yes), heating block temperature: 60°C
- **Solution Preparation Method**: Robot-mixed (Mixed: Yes)
- **Solution Rest Time**: 1 day
- **Casting Conditions**:
  - 8.0 minute wait time between coupon casting and NIPS bath immersion
  - 65% relative humidity during synthesis
  - No nitrogen flow during drop-casting (Nitrogen Side from drop: No)
  - Laminar dry nitrogen flow applied after blade-casting (Nitrogen After blade: Yes)

## Rationale:

1. **Increased polymer concentration** (from 17% to 19%): Higher polymer concentrations typically lead to denser membrane structures with improved mechanical properties, including elastic modulus.

2. **Added heating during preparation**: Heating improves polymer dissolution and creates more homogeneous solutions, which can lead to more uniform membrane structures with better mechanical integrity.

3. **Robot-mixed solution**: Automated mixing should provide more consistent solution properties compared to manual mixing.

4. **1-day rest time**: Allowing the solution to rest for a short period may help release trapped air bubbles and allow polymer chains to reach equilibrium configurations.

5. **Slightly reduced wait time** (from 10 to 8 minutes): This adjustment may help optimize the initial phase separation process.

6. **Maintained nitrogen flow after blade-casting**: This feature from your previous experiment appears beneficial for controlling evaporation rates during the critical initial phase separation.

This parameter set builds upon your previous experiment while making strategic adjustments to potentially enhance the elastic modulus of the resulting membrane.",207.09310351510177,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two previous experiments, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experimental Parameters

- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% polysulfone
- **Solution Preparation**: 
  - Heating: Yes
  - Heating block temperature: 40°C
  - Mixed: No (manually premixed)
- **Solution Rest Time**: 2 days
- **Casting Conditions**:
  - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time: 8.0 minutes
  - Relative Humidity: 65%
  - Nitrogen (Side from drop): Yes
  - Nitrogen (After blade): Yes

## Rationale

1. **Increased Polymer Concentration**: The higher modulus was observed with 17% concentration compared to 14%. Increasing to 18% may further enhance mechanical properties.

2. **Adding Heat During Preparation**: This could improve polymer dissolution and solution homogeneity, potentially leading to better chain entanglement and higher modulus.

3. **Rest Time**: Extending rest time from 0-1 days to 2 days may allow better polymer relaxation and entanglement.

4. **Combined Nitrogen Flow**: Using nitrogen flow both during drop-casting and after blade-casting combines the beneficial aspects of both previous experiments.

5. **Optimized Wait Time**: 8 minutes before immersion provides controlled solvent evaporation that may enhance skin layer formation and mechanical strength.

This parameter set builds upon the strengths observed in both previous experiments while introducing controlled modifications to potentially maximize the elastic modulus.",197.84044623035882,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three previous experiments and their resulting elastic modulus values, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (Automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (No heating during solution preparation)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (Increasing from the 17.0% that showed good results)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (Ambient temperature)
- **Mixed**: No (Use manually premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (Use immediately after preparation)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 68%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (211.51) was observed in Experiment 54, which used 17% concentration, 10-minute wait time, 68% humidity, and nitrogen flow after blade-casting.
2. I'm recommending a slight increase in polymer concentration to 18% as higher concentrations generally lead to denser membrane structures with potentially higher mechanical strength.
3. Maintaining the 10-minute wait time between casting and bath immersion appears beneficial, as it likely allows for controlled solvent evaporation that enhances membrane structure.
4. The 68% relative humidity from the best-performing experiment should be maintained.
5. The use of nitrogen flow after blade-casting but not during drop-casting appears to be optimal based on the best result.
6. Using the solution immediately (0 days rest time) appears to yield better results than allowing it to rest.

This recommendation aims to build upon the conditions that produced the highest modulus while making a strategic adjustment to polymer concentration to potentially further enhance mechanical properties.",219.61643412334288,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the previous experimental data, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (Automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (Ambient temperature 25°C)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% polysulfone
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (ambient)
- **Mixed**: No (Use premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (Use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 68%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (219.62) was observed in experiment #55, which used 17% concentration, 10-minute wait time, 68% humidity, and nitrogen after blade casting.

2. I'm recommending a slight increase in polymer concentration to 18% because:
   - Higher polymer concentrations generally lead to denser membrane structures
   - The best performing experiment used 17%, suggesting that higher concentrations may be beneficial
   - The trend across experiments shows better modulus with higher concentrations

3. Maintaining the 10-minute wait time before bath immersion appears critical, as experiments with this longer wait time consistently showed higher modulus values.

4. The 68% relative humidity condition from the best-performing experiment should be maintained.

5. The use of nitrogen flow after blade casting but not during side-drop appears to be optimal based on the best-performing experiment.

This recommendation aims to build upon the successful conditions of experiment #55 while making a strategic adjustment to polymer concentration to potentially further improve the elastic modulus.",272.2240045816517,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the previous experimental data, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from 17.0% as higher concentration showed better results)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature 25°C)
- **Mixed**: No (manually premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately after preparation)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 55% (targeting the mid-range between the successful 58% and lower values)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (apply laminar nitrogen flow after blade casting)

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (272.22) was observed in experiment #56 with 17% concentration, 10-minute wait time, 58% humidity, and nitrogen flow after blade casting.
2. Slightly increasing the polymer concentration to 18% may further enhance the modulus by creating a denser polymer matrix.
3. Maintaining the 10-minute wait time before bath immersion appears critical, as it likely allows optimal partial solvent evaporation.
4. The data suggests that applying nitrogen flow after blade casting but not during drop-casting produces superior results.
5. Manually premixed solutions without heating consistently performed better than robot-mixed or heated solutions.
6. Using the solution immediately (0 days rest time) appears optimal based on the best-performing experiments.

Based on the prior observations, I'll analyze the data to identify patterns that correlate with higher modulus values and recommend the next experimental parameters.

## Analysis of Prior Results:
- Highest modulus (272.22): Experiment 56 with 17% concentration, 0 days rest, 10 min wait time, 58% RH, no nitrogen during drop, yes nitrogen after blade
- Second highest (219.62): Experiment 55 with similar parameters but 68% RH
- Lower modulus (168.33): Experiment 51 with only 1 min wait time (vs 10 min in higher modulus experiments)

## Key Patterns:
1. Higher polymer concentration (17%) correlates with higher modulus
2. Longer coupon-to-bath wait times (10 min) significantly improve modulus
3. Mid-range humidity (58%) appears optimal compared to higher humidity (68-70%)
4. Applying nitrogen after blade casting is consistently present in higher modulus samples
5. No heating and using premixed solutions appears beneficial

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature 25°C)
- **Concentration**: 18% (slightly higher than previous best)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C (ambient)
- **Mixed**: No (use premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 55% (slightly lower than previous best)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

This experiment builds on the successful parameters from Experiment 56 (highest modulus) while making strategic adjustments to potentially further improve the modulus by slightly increasing polymer concentration and optimizing humidity conditions.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
