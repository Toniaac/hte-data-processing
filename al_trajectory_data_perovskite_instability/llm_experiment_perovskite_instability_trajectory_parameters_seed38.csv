The current composition (CsPbI: 0.31, FAPbI: 0.36, MAPbI: 0.33) shows a high instability index of 701,140, indicating poor stability.

For my recommendation, I'll consider that:
1. Cesium (Cs) typically enhances thermal stability
2. Formamidinium (FA) can improve light absorption but may reduce stability
3. Methylammonium (MA) is often less stable under heat and humidity

I suggest testing:
**CsPbI: 0.50, FAPbI: 0.40, MAPbI: 0.10**

This composition:
- Increases the CsPbI content significantly to improve thermal stability
- Slightly increases FAPbI to maintain good optoelectronic properties
- Reduces MAPbI content substantially as it's typically the least stable component

This should provide a good balance between stability and performance while staying within your specified component ranges.",714735,23707,Continuing
