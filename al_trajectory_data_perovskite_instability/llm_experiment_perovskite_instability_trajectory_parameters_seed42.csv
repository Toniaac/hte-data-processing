The observation shows a composition with CsPbI = 0.16, FAPbI = 0.84, and MAPbI = 0.0, which resulted in an instability index of 57484.0 (where lower values would indicate better stability).

For my suggestion, I'll recommend increasing the cesium content while decreasing the formamidinium content, as cesium often contributes to better structural stability in perovskites:

**Suggested composition to test next:**
- CsPbI: 0.30
- FAPbI: 0.70
- MAPbI: 0.00

This adjustment increases the cesium content which may help improve the structural stability while maintaining a methylammonium-free composition, which is often beneficial for thermal stability.",456484,23707,Continuing

Looking at the two data points:
1. CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 → Instability index: 57,484
2. CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16 → Instability index: 456,484

The first composition shows significantly better stability (lower instability index). This suggests that higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content may be beneficial for stability.

For the next composition to test, I recommend:

CsPbI: 0.10, FAPbI: 0.90, MAPbI: 0.00

This composition further reduces CsPbI while increasing FAPbI compared to the more stable composition, following the trend observed in the data. I've kept MAPbI at 0 since the more stable composition had no MAPbI content.",293210,23707,Continuing

Looking at the data:

2. CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16 → Instability indices: 456,484 and 293,210 (much higher instability)

The composition with the lowest instability index contains a lower amount of CsPbI (0.16) and a higher amount of FAPbI (0.84), with no MAPbI. This suggests that:
- Higher FAPbI content appears beneficial for stability
- Lower CsPbI content appears beneficial
- Absence of MAPbI may be favorable

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.10, FAPbI: 0.90, MAPbI: 0.00

- CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16 showed instability indices of 456484 and 293210

The composition with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 showed the lowest instability index (57484), suggesting that higher FAPbI content with some CsPbI might be beneficial for stability.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0

This slightly increases the CsPbI content while maintaining a high FAPbI content and keeping MAPbI at zero, which might help us determine if a slightly higher CsPbI content can further improve stability while maintaining the benefits of the FAPbI-rich composition.",144074,23707,Continuing

This suggests that increasing the CsPbI content slightly from 0.16 to 0.25 while decreasing FAPbI from 0.84 to 0.75 improved stability in one case. Following this trend, I suggest:

Parameters: CsPbI: 0.35, FAPbI: 0.65, MAPbI: 0.0

However, there's some inconsistency since this composition appears twice with very different instability indices (57,484 and 286,689).

The second best result came from:
CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0

This suggests that compositions with higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content (with no MAPbI) tend to have better stability. However, there might be an optimal ratio between CsPbI and FAPbI.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:
CsPbI: 0.20, FAPbI: 0.80, MAPbI: 0.0

Since the CsPbI/FAPbI mixtures without MAPbI showed the best stability, and there appears to be a sweet spot with CsPbI content between 0.16-0.25, I suggest testing:

Parameters: CsPbI: 0.20, FAPbI: 0.80, MAPbI: 0.0

3. Includes a small amount of MAPbI (0.03), as the best performing sample included some MAPbI
