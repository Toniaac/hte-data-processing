The current composition (CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03) shows a relatively high instability index of 38370. 

For my recommendation, I'll consider that:
1. FA-based perovskites often have good optoelectronic properties but can suffer from phase instability
2. Cs+ can enhance thermal and moisture stability
3. MA+ can help with crystallization but is often less stable than Cs+

I suggest testing:
**CsPbI: 0.30, FAPbI: 0.65, MAPbI: 0.05**

This composition:
- Increases the Cs+ content to improve stability
- Reduces the FA+ content which may be contributing to instability
- Slightly increases MA+ to maintain good crystallization properties
- Maintains the total at 1.00 (0.30 + 0.65 + 0.05 = 1.00)",383479,23707,Continuing

Looking at the two data points:
1. CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03 → Instability index: 38,370
2. CsPbI: 0.32, FAPbI: 0.67, MAPbI: 0.01 → Instability index: 383,479

The first composition has a significantly lower instability index, suggesting better stability. I notice that:
- The more stable composition has lower CsPbI content
- The more stable composition has higher FAPbI content
- The more stable composition has slightly higher MAPbI content

Suggested composition:
CsPbI: 0.15
FAPbI: 0.82
MAPbI: 0.03

The first composition showed the best stability (lowest instability index). The second composition with increased CsPbI and decreased FAPbI showed significantly worse stability. The third test repeated the first composition but with a higher instability index, suggesting some variability in the measurements.

For the next composition, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.20, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.05

This composition:
- Makes a small increase in CsPbI from 0.17 to 0.20 (avoiding the large jump to 0.32 that caused instability)
- Slightly decreases FAPbI from 0.80 to 0.75
- Slightly increases MAPbI from 0.03 to 0.05
- Maintains the sum of components at 1.00
