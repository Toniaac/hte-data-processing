The current composition (CsPbI: 0.83, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.17) shows a high instability index of 374,938, indicating poor stability.

For my recommendation, I'll consider that:
1. The current composition has no FAPbI content
2. Literature suggests that incorporating some FAPbI can enhance stability
3. Cs-rich compositions often show better thermal stability but may have phase segregation issues
4. A balanced mixture might provide better overall stability

Suggested next composition to test:
CsPbI: 0.70
FAPbI: 0.20
MAPbI: 0.10

This composition:
- Reduces the CsPbI content slightly
- Introduces FAPbI which may improve stability
- Reduces MAPbI which is often associated with moisture sensitivity
- Maintains the total at 1.00 (0.70 + 0.20 + 0.10 = 1.00)",199330,23707,Continuing

The instability index decreased from 374938 to 199330 when FAPbI was increased from 0.0 to 0.03 and MAPbI was decreased from 0.17 to 0.14, while CsPbI remained relatively high at 0.83.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.83
FAPbI: 0.07
MAPbI: 0.10

This composition continues the trend of increasing FAPbI and decreasing MAPbI while maintaining the same CsPbI content. The previous change showed that a small addition of FAPbI with a corresponding reduction in MAPbI significantly improved stability, so this composition explores whether continuing this trend yields further improvements.",119938,23707,Continuing

Additionally, a moderate amount of CsPbI seems beneficial.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.20
FAPbI: 0.75
MAPbI: 0.05

This composition:
1. Maintains a similar ratio to your most stable sample (CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03)
2. Slightly increases CsPbI content
3. Slightly decreases FAPbI content
4. Slightly increases MAPbI content

Looking at the trends:
- The composition with CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.03 appears twice with the lowest instability indices (119938 and 107494)
- When CsPbI was high (0.83) and FAPbI was low (0-0.03), the instability was much higher
- Increasing FAPbI content while decreasing CsPbI seems to improve stability
- Low MAPbI content (0.03) in the most stable compositions suggests minimizing MAPbI may be beneficial

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

**CsPbI: 0.15, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.03**

This composition:
- Further reduces CsPbI slightly from 0.17 to 0.15
- Increases FAPbI slightly from 0.80 to 0.82
- Maintains the low MAPbI content at 0.03
- Maintains the sum of components at 1.00

This composition appears multiple times in your data with varying instability indices, suggesting some experimental variability, but consistently showing good stability.

For the next composition to test, I recommend:

**CsPbI: 0.15, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.03**

To continue exploring this promising region, I recommend testing:

CsPbI: 0.15, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.03

This composition:
1. Slightly decreases CsPbI from 0.17 to 0.15
2. Slightly increases FAPbI from 0.80 to 0.82
