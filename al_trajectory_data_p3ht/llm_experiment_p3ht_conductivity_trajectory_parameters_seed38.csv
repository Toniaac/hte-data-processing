- D1 has a relatively high content (41.85%) in a composition that showed good conductivity
- P3HT is at a moderate level (39.05%)
- The other components (D2, D6, D8) are at lower percentages

Since we don't have multiple data points to establish clear trends, I'll suggest a strategic modification to explore the composition space:

- D1: 50.00%
- D2: 5.00%
- D6: 5.00%

1. Slightly decreased P3HT content to allow for increased D1
2. Increased D1 content since it appears to be a significant component in the conductive formulation
3. Maintained similar but slightly adjusted levels of D2, D6, and D8

   - D1 content around 40-45%
   - Low to moderate D2 content (0.1-3.5%)

47,128,"P3HT content (%): 42.33, D1 content (%): 51.83, D2 content (%): 2.75, D6 content (%): 2.87, D8 content (%): 0.32, Conductivity (measured) (S/cm): 1243.67","Based on the experimental data provided, I'll analyze the patterns to suggest a composition that might yield high electrical conductivity.

Looking at the data, I observe several key trends:
1. The highest conductivity values (>700 S/cm) generally have P3HT content around 40-45% and D1 content around 55-60%
2. Very low amounts of D2, D6, and D8 (typically <1% each) appear in the highest performing compositions
3. The composition with the highest conductivity (1089.12 S/cm) has: P3HT 44.3%, D1 54.68%, D2 0.04%, D6 0.29%, D8 0.78%
4. Another high performer (904.29 S/cm) has: P3HT 40.67%, D1 59.26%, D2 0.04%, D6 0.04%, D8 0.07%

Based on these observations, I suggest testing the following composition:

P3HT content (%): 42.0
D1 content (%): 57.5
D2 content (%): 0.1
D6 content (%): 0.2
D8 content (%): 0.2

This composition:
- Maintains the optimal P3HT:D1 ratio seen in high-performing samples
- Keeps the minor components (D2, D6, D8) at very low levels
- Slightly adjusts the P3HT and D1 content to explore the space between the two highest performing compositions
- Ensures all components sum to 100%
- Falls within the specified component ranges",1243.67,1243.67,Max conductivity reached
