Rationale:
1. I've slightly decreased the P3HT content from 81.71% to 75.00% to allow for increased CNT loading while maintaining good polymer-CNT interactions.

2. I've increased the double-walled CNT (D6) content from 8.58% to 12.00% since these appeared to contribute significantly to conductivity in the prior sample.

3. I've moderately increased both long and short single-walled CNTs (D1 and D2) to enhance the conductive network formation while maintaining a balance between long-range connectivity and network density.

4. I've eliminated the multi-walled CNTs (D8) completely since they appeared to contribute minimally to conductivity in the previous composition.

# Suggested Composition for Next Test

- P3HT: 70.00%

- Short single-walled CNTs (D2): 5.00%
- Double-walled CNTs (D6): 15.00%
- Multi-walled CNTs (D8): 0.00%

## Rationale

1. **Reduced P3HT content**: I've decreased the P3HT content from the first sample's 81.71% to 70.00% to allow for higher overall CNT loading, which should enhance the conductive network formation while still providing sufficient polymer matrix for good dispersion.

2. **Increased D6 content**: The first sample showed excellent conductivity with 8.58% double-walled CNTs (D6). I've increased this to 15.00% as D6 CNTs appear to provide an optimal balance between flexibility and charge transport capabilities.

3. **Increased D1 content**: I've increased the long single-walled CNTs (D1) from 4.33% to 10.00% to enhance long-range connectivity in the conductive network, which should improve overall conductivity.

4. **Maintained moderate D2 content**: I've kept a moderate amount (5.00%) of short single-walled CNTs (D2) to maintain network density and junction points.

5. **Eliminated D8**: I've removed multi-walled CNTs (D8) completely as they appeared to contribute minimally to conductivity in the first sample.

The highest conductivity observed (457.13 S/cm) was achieved with a composition containing high D1 content (43.74%) and relatively low P3HT (46.86%). This suggests that long single-walled CNTs (D1) are particularly effective at creating conductive pathways. The second-best composition had high P3HT (81.71%) with a mix of CNTs dominated by D6 (8.58%), achieving 86.01 S/cm.

P3HT: 40.00%
D1: 50.00%
D2: 5.00%
D6: 5.00%
D8: 0.00%

Rationale:
1. I've decreased P3HT slightly from the best-performing sample to allow for more CNT content while maintaining sufficient polymer for good dispersion.
2. I've increased D1 content to 50% (within its 0-60% range) since long SWCNTs appear to be the most effective conductivity enhancers.
3. I've maintained a small amount of D2 (5%) to provide additional junction points in the network.
4. I've included a small amount of D6 (5%) as double-walled CNTs showed positive contributions in the first sample.

I notice that we haven't explored compositions with slightly higher D6 (double-walled CNT) content.
