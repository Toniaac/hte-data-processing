- D2 (Short single-walled CNTs): 0.00%
- D6 (Double-walled CNTs): 3.00%
- D8 (Multi-walled CNTs): 7.00%

Rationale:
1. I've increased the total CNT content from 10.45% to 20.00% to enhance the conductive network while maintaining good processability.
2. The long single-walled CNTs (D1) have been increased from 5.72% to 10.00% since they were identified as particularly effective for creating extended conductive pathways.
3. I've eliminated the short single-walled CNTs (D2) as they showed minimal contribution at low concentrations.
4. I've slightly increased the double-walled CNTs (D6) from 1.80% to 3.00% to maintain mechanical stability.
5. I've significantly increased the multi-walled CNTs (D8) from 2.10% to 7.00% to enhance current-carrying capacity and create more robust conductive pathways.

The data suggests that:
1. Long single-walled CNTs (D1) appear more effective at creating conductive pathways
2. A relatively high P3HT content (85-90%) seems beneficial

D2: 0.00% (minimized as it appears less effective)
D6: 3.00% (slightly increased from first sample)
D8: 2.00% (similar to first sample)

These results suggest that optimal conductivity is achieved with:
1. P3HT content around 42-47%
2. High D1 (long SWCNT) content around 49-53%
3. Minimal amounts of other CNT types

For my recommendation, I'll suggest a composition that builds on these successful formulations while staying within your specified component ranges:

**Recommended composition:**
- P3HT: 45.00%
- D1 (long SWCNT): 50.00%
- D2 (short SWCNT): 2.00%
- D6 (DWCNT): 2.00%
- D8 (MWCNT): 1.00%

This composition maintains the successful balance of high D1 content with moderate P3HT content that has produced the highest conductivities in your previous experiments. The small amounts of D2, D6, and D8 may help fill gaps in the conductive network formed primarily by the long SWCNTs, potentially enhancing overall connectivity while maintaining the dominance of the most effective conductive component (D1).",529.11,1243.67,Continuing

The highest conductivity values (>500 S/cm) were observed in compositions with:

2. High proportion of long single-walled CNTs (D1) around 50-53%
3. Minimal but strategic use of other CNT types

Looking at the most successful compositions (545.18 S/cm and 543.75 S/cm), they share similar characteristics: P3HT content of ~45%, D1 content of ~50-53%, and small amounts of other CNT types.

For my recommendation, I'll suggest:

P3HT: 44.00%
D1 (long single-walled CNTs): 53.00%
D2 (short single-walled CNTs): 1.50%
D6 (double-walled CNTs): 1.20%
D8 (multi-walled CNTs): 0.30%

This composition:
- Maintains the optimal P3HT:CNT ratio (~44:56) seen in high-performing samples
- Maximizes the content of long SWCNTs (D1) which consistently correlate with high conductivity
- Includes small amounts of other CNT types to fill gaps in the conductive network
- Falls within the specified component ranges
- Follows the pattern of the highest-performing compositions while slightly adjusting the balance to potentially optimize conductivity further",535.99,1243.67,Continuing

The data shows that the highest conductivities (>500 S/cm) were achieved with compositions containing:
- P3HT around 42-46%
- Long single-walled CNTs (D1) as the dominant CNT type at ~50-53%
- Small amounts of other CNT types

Looking at the most successful compositions (those with conductivities of 529.11, 535.99, 543.75, and 545.18 S/cm), I notice they all share similar characteristics:
1. P3HT content between 42-45%

This composition maintains the optimal P3HT:CNT ratio while emphasizing long single-walled CNTs that create extended conductive pathways with minimal junction resistance.
