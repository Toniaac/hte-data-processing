1,128,"P3HT content (%): 42.33, D1 content (%): 51.83, D2 content (%): 2.75, D6 content (%): 2.87, D8 content (%): 0.32, Conductivity (measured) (S/cm): 1243.67","Based on the prior observation, I'll suggest a new composition to test that aims to further optimize the electrical conductivity of the P3HT/CNT thin film.

Suggested composition:
- P3HT: 35.00%
- D1 (Long single-walled CNTs): 60.00%
- D2 (Short single-walled CNTs): 3.00%
- D6 (Double-walled CNTs): 2.00%
- D8 (Multi-walled CNTs): 0.00%

Rationale:
1. The previous sample showed excellent conductivity with high D1 content (51.83%), so I'm increasing D1 to the maximum allowed (60.00%) to further enhance the conductive network.
2. I'm reducing P3HT content from 42.33% to 35.00% to accommodate more conductive CNT material while maintaining sufficient polymer for film formation.
3. I'm slightly increasing D2 to 3.00% to help fill gaps in the primary D1 network.
4. I'm slightly reducing D6 to 2.00% as the previous sample suggests the long SWCNTs (D1) are more beneficial.
5. I'm eliminating D8 (MWCNTs) as they appeared to have minimal contribution at 0.32% in the previous sample.

This composition maintains the successful strategy of using predominantly long SWCNTs while pushing the CNT:polymer ratio higher to potentially achieve even greater conductivity.",1243.67,1243.67,Max conductivity reached
