Based on the single data point provided (Experiment ID 12), I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment aimed at maximizing the elastic modulus of the membrane.

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment

- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 15.0% polysulfone (increased from 10.0%)
- **Heating**: Yes
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (reduced from 2 days)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2.0 minutes (increased from 0.0 min)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (reduced from 56%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale

1. **Increased Polymer Concentration** (15% vs 10%): Higher polymer concentration typically leads to denser membrane structures with improved mechanical properties, including elastic modulus.

2. **Added Heating**: Heating during solution preparation can improve polymer dissolution and distribution, potentially leading to more uniform membrane structures with better mechanical properties.

3. **Reduced Rest Time** (1 day vs 2 days): A shorter rest time may reduce the chance of polymer aggregation while still allowing adequate dissolution.

4. **Added Wait Time Before Bath Immersion** (2.0 min): This controlled delay allows partial solvent evaporation, which can create a denser skin layer and potentially increase modulus.

5. **Lower Relative Humidity** (40% vs 56%): Lower humidity can control the rate of phase separation, potentially leading to stronger membrane structures.

6. **Added Nitrogen Flow**: Nitrogen flow during and after casting can help control the phase separation process by creating a more controlled atmosphere above the casting solution.

This recommendation aims to systematically explore parameters that could increase membrane modulus based on general principles of membrane formation via NIPS.",48.22854697312115,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior experiments, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 15% polysulfone (increased from 10%)
- **Solution Preparation**: 
  - Automatically mixed by robotic system (Mixed: Yes)
  - Apply heating during mixing (Heating: Yes)
  - Heating block temperature: 40°C
  - Solution rest time: 3 days (maintained from Experiment 13)

## Casting Conditions
- **Environmental Conditions**: 55% relative humidity (maintained from Experiment 13)
- **Casting Process**:
  - Automated blade casting
  - Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time: 1 minute (slight increase from 0 minutes)
  - Apply nitrogen flow after blade casting (Nitrogen (After blade): Yes)
  - No nitrogen flow from side during drop (Nitrogen (Side from drop): No)

## Rationale
1. Increasing polymer concentration from 10% to 15% should create a denser polymer matrix, potentially increasing mechanical strength and modulus.
2. Adding heating during mixing should improve polymer dissolution and solution homogeneity.
3. Maintaining the 3-day rest time from Experiment 13, which showed higher modulus than Experiment 12's 2-day rest.
4. Adding a short 1-minute wait time before bath immersion may allow for partial solvent evaporation, potentially creating a denser skin layer.
5. Adding nitrogen flow after blade casting may help control the initial phase separation process.

This recommendation aims to build upon the conditions that produced the higher modulus in Experiment 13 while introducing controlled modifications to potentially further enhance mechanical properties.",207.09310351510177,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three prior experiments, I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 16.0%
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature of 25°C)
- **Mixed**: Yes (automatically mixed by robotic system)
- **Rest time**: 1 day
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 54%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (207.09 bar) was observed in Experiment #29, which used 14% polymer concentration and nitrogen flow during drop-casting.
2. Increasing the polymer concentration from 14% to 16% may further enhance the modulus, as higher polymer concentrations typically yield stronger membranes.
3. A short rest time (1 day) appears optimal based on Experiment #29's superior results.
4. Maintaining the successful parameters from Experiment #29: immediate immersion in the non-solvent bath, nitrogen flow during drop-casting, and relative humidity around 54%.
5. The automated process provides better reproducibility and precision in membrane formation.

This recommendation aims to build upon the most successful experiment while making a strategic adjustment to polymer concentration to potentially achieve even higher modulus values.",220.5104016857166,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus of the membranes:

1. **Polymer concentration**: Higher concentrations (14-16%) yielded significantly higher modulus values compared to 10% concentration
2. **Nitrogen flow during drop-casting**: Experiments with nitrogen flow from the side during drop-casting (Exp #29, #30) showed much higher modulus values
3. **Rest time**: 1 day rest time appears optimal in the high-performing experiments

For the next experiment, I recommend the following parameters to maximize modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes (immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 54% (maintain the level from high-performing experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (apply during drop-casting)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

This recommendation builds on the successful conditions from experiments #29 and #30 while increasing the polymer concentration to potentially further enhance the modulus. The immediate immersion in the non-solvent bath and the use of nitrogen flow during drop-casting appear to be critical factors for achieving high modulus values.",88.47667256854467,296.35081017123304,Continuing

1. The highest modulus values (207.09 and 220.51 bar) were observed with higher polymer concentrations (14% and 16% respectively).
2. Both high-performing experiments used 1 day rest time, suggesting optimal dissolution without excessive aging.
3. Nitrogen flow during drop-casting appears beneficial (used in both high-modulus experiments).
4. Immediate immersion in the non-solvent bath (0.0 min wait time) was consistent across all experiments.
5. A moderate relative humidity (~50-54%) appears optimal.

1. The highest modulus values (228.47, 272.22, 219.62 bar) were observed with 17% polymer concentration and manually premixed solutions.
2. Extended wait times (10 minutes) before bath immersion consistently produced higher modulus values.
3. Applying nitrogen after blade casting appears beneficial for modulus enhancement.
4. Slightly increasing the polymer concentration to 18% may further improve the modulus while staying within reasonable processing limits.
5. Using the solution immediately after preparation (0 days rest time) has shown better results than aged solutions.
6. Moderate humidity (around 60%) appears optimal based on the data trends.

This parameter set builds upon the successful conditions from experiments #56 and #55 while making a strategic increase in polymer concentration to potentially achieve even higher modulus values.",224.5706110108938,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the experimental data provided, I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment that should maximize the elastic modulus.

## Analysis of Current Data
From the previous experiments, I observe several trends:
- Higher polymer concentrations (16-17%) consistently yield higher modulus values
- Premixed solutions (not robot-mixed) tend to perform better
- Short or no rest time appears beneficial for higher modulus
- Nitrogen flow after blade casting with longer wait times (10 minutes) produced the highest modulus (272.22 bar in experiment #56)
- Moderate to high humidity (50-70%) appears favorable

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% (slightly higher than previous best)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature of 25°C)
- **Mixed**: No (manually premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 60%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

This experiment builds on the success of experiment #56 (which achieved 272.22 bar) but increases the polymer concentration slightly to potentially achieve even higher modulus while maintaining the other successful parameters (long wait time with nitrogen flow after blade casting).",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
