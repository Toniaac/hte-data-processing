The observation shows a composition with CsPbI = 0.16, FAPbI = 0.84, and MAPbI = 0.0, which resulted in an instability index of 57484.0 (where lower values would indicate better stability).

For my suggestion, I'll recommend:

**CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0**

Rationale:
- Increasing the CsPbI content from 0.16 to 0.25 may improve stability, as cesium cations are known to enhance structural stability in perovskites
- Slightly reducing the FAPbI content to maintain the proper stoichiometry
- Keeping MAPbI at 0 since the prior formulation didn't include it, and introducing it without more data points might be risky

This composition maintains the binary mixture approach while shifting toward higher cesium content, which often contributes to better thermal and moisture stability in perovskite structures.",456484,23707,Continuing

The data shows:
- Composition 1: CsPbI (0.16), FAPbI (0.84), MAPbI (0.0) had an instability index of 57,484
- Composition 2: CsPbI (0.84), FAPbI (0.0), MAPbI (0.16) had a much higher instability index of 456,484

The first composition with higher FAPbI content showed significantly better stability (lower instability index). This suggests that increasing the FAPbI component while maintaining some CsPbI might be beneficial.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.25
FAPbI: 0.75
MAPbI: 0.0

This composition:
- Slightly increases CsPbI from the more stable composition
- Maintains a high FAPbI content
- Continues to exclude MAPbI which was present in the less stable composition

This will help determine if a slightly higher CsPbI content can further improve stability while maintaining the benefits of the FAPbI-rich composition.",293210,23707,Continuing

Looking at the data:
1. Cs₀.₁₆FA₀.₈₄Pb₁I₃ had an instability index of 57,484 (lowest/best)
2. Cs₀.₈₄MA₀.₁₆Pb₁I₃ had instability indices of 456,484 and 293,210 (much higher/worse)

The composition with the highest FA content and lowest Cs content showed the best stability. This suggests we should explore compositions with higher FA content.

I recommend testing:
**Cs₀.₁₀FA₀.₉₀MA₀.₀₀Pb₁I₃**

This composition:
- Increases the FA content from 0.84 to 0.90
- Decreases the Cs content from 0.16 to 0.10
- Maintains zero MA content (as MA appears to worsen stability)

This follows the trend that higher FA content appears to improve stability while keeping within the specified component ranges.",286689,23707,Continuing

- CsPbI: 0.84, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.16 showed instability indices of 456484 and 293210

The composition with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 showed the lowest instability index (57484), suggesting that higher FAPbI content with some CsPbI might be promising for stability.

For the next test, I suggest:
CsPbI: 0.20, FAPbI: 0.80, MAPbI: 0.00

This slightly increases the CsPbI content while maintaining a high FAPbI content, which could potentially improve stability while building on the most promising composition observed so far.",91681,23707,Continuing

The composition with CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 showed the lowest instability index (57484) in one test, and increasing CsPbI slightly to 0.2 while keeping MAPbI at 0 showed a moderate instability (91681).

For the next composition, I suggest:

Parameters: CsPbI: 0.25, FAPbI: 0.75, MAPbI: 0.0

The second lowest instability index (91,681) was observed with:
CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, MAPbI: 0.0

This suggests that compositions with higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content (with no MAPbI) tend to have better stability. However, when CsPbI was increased to 0.25, the instability increased again.

For the next experiment, I suggest testing:
CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.0

Looking at the trend, there appears to be a sweet spot in the CsPbI/FAPbI ratio that minimizes instability. Since the composition with CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82 performed significantly better than both CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84 and CsPbI: 0.2, FAPbI: 0.8, I would suggest exploring compositions very close to this optimal point.

For the next composition to test, I suggest:

CsPbI: 0.19, FAPbI: 0.81, MAPbI: 0.0

Looking at the pattern, it appears that compositions with higher FAPbI content and lower CsPbI content (around 0.16-0.20) tend to perform better, while compositions with high CsPbI content (0.84) showed much higher instability indices. Additionally, the compositions without MAPbI generally performed better.

For the next experiment, I suggest testing:

Parameters: CsPbI: 0.17, FAPbI: 0.83, MAPbI: 0.0

This composition is between the two best performing samples (CsPbI: 0.16, FAPbI: 0.84, MAPbI: 0.0 with instability index 57484, and CsPbI: 0.18, FAPbI: 0.82, MAPbI: 0.0 with instability index 27122).
