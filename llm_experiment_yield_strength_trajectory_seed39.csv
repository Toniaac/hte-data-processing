Looking at the data, I notice that compositions with high nickel, cobalt, titanium, and molybdenum content, combined with very low carbon, tend to produce the highest yield strengths (often exceeding 2000 MPa).

My suggested composition is:

Fe: 0.650
Ni: 0.180
Co: 0.126
Ti: 0.022
Mo: 0.021
Al: 0.0010

Mn: 0.000100
Si: 0.000200
Cr: 0.000102
V: 0.000113
Nb: 0.000062

This composition follows the pattern of successful high-strength steels from the reports, particularly focusing on:
1. High nickel content (18%) to promote martensite formation
2. High cobalt content (12.6%) to enhance precipitation kinetics
3. Significant titanium (2.2%) and molybdenum (2.1%) for strong precipitation hardening
4. Very low carbon to avoid carbide formation and focus on intermetallic precipitation
5. Small amounts of aluminum to contribute to precipitation hardening
6. Trace amounts of V and Nb for grain refinement

This composition resembles a maraging steel that should develop exceptional strength through precipitation hardening mechanisms when properly heat treated.",1267.1,Continuing,2510.3

The reports consistently show that maraging steels with high nickel, cobalt, titanium, and molybdenum content demonstrate the highest yield strengths, often exceeding 2000 MPa. The most successful compositions featured:
- High nickel (17-18%)
- High cobalt (11-15%)
- Significant titanium (1.8-2.3%)
- Moderate molybdenum (2.0-2.4%)
- Very low carbon content
- Some aluminum (0.2-0.5%)

Fe: 0.650000
Ni: 0.180000

This composition optimizes the key strengthening elements while maintaining proper balance for precipitation hardening, which appears to be the dominant strengthening mechanism in the highest-strength samples.",2510.3,Max yield strength reached,2510.3
