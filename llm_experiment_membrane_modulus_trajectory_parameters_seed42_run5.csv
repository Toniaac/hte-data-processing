# Recommended Next Experiment

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Auto | True | Maintain automation for consistency |
| Heating | True | Try heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution and chain entanglement |
| Concentration | 15.0 | Increase polymer concentration as higher concentrations typically yield higher mechanical strength |
| Heating Block Temperature | 40 | Moderate heating to enhance polymer dissolution without degradation |
| Mixed | True | Continue with robot mixing for reproducibility |
| Rest Time (days) | 1 | Reduce rest time to minimize potential polymer aggregation |
| Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min) | 2.0 | Introduce a short delay to allow for controlled surface film formation |
| Relative Humidity | 40 | Lower humidity to reduce water vapor absorption during casting |
| Nitrogen (Side from drop) | 1 | Add nitrogen flow to create more controlled atmosphere during casting |
| Nitrogen (After blade) | 1 | Add nitrogen flow after blade to promote more uniform solvent evaporation |

The high standard deviation in your current result (39.76 bar) suggests significant variability in the membrane structure. The proposed parameters aim to create more controlled conditions that should lead to more uniform membrane formation and potentially higher modulus values.",110.69482106635698,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two prior observations, I can see that the second experiment (Index 77) produced a significantly higher modulus (110.69 bar) compared to the first experiment (39.59 bar). The key differences that likely contributed to this improvement were:

1. **Heating**: Changed from False to True
2. **Concentration**: Increased from 10.0% to 15.0%
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Increased from 25°C to 80°C
4. **Relative Humidity**: Slightly higher (58% vs 56%)

For the next experiment, I recommend building on these findings by further optimizing these parameters:

## Recommended Next Experiment Parameters:
- **Auto**: True (maintain automated process)
- **Heating**: True (maintain heating which showed benefit)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increase further as higher concentration improved modulus)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 85°C (slightly increase from previous successful experiment)
- **Mixed**: True (maintain robot mixing)
- **Rest Time (days)**: 3 (slightly increase to allow better polymer chain organization)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min)**: 0.5 (introduce slight delay which may improve phase separation)
- **Relative Humidity**: 60% (slightly increase as trend shows benefit)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: 0 (maintain current setting)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: 0 (maintain current setting)

2. **Heating**: Experiments with heating (True) showed significantly higher modulus values than without heating
3. **Heating Block Temperature**: Higher temperature (80°C) appears beneficial
4. **Mixed**: The highest modulus was achieved with Mixed = False (pre-mixed solution)

Based on the provided experimental data, I've analyzed the patterns that lead to higher elastic modulus values. The highest modulus observed was 277.39 bar (Index 68), followed by 272.22 bar (Index 56).

## Key Observations:
- Higher polymer concentration (17%) generally yields higher modulus values
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time of 10.0 minutes appears beneficial
- Using Nitrogen (After blade) = 1 is associated with higher modulus
- No heating appears preferable for maximizing modulus
- Automated synthesis consistently produces better results
- Relative humidity around 50-70% seems optimal

## Recommended Next Experiment:

```
Index: [next sequential number]
Auto: True
Heating: False
Concentration: 20.0 (increasing to maximum in range)
Heating Block Temperature: 25
Mixed: False
Rest Time (days): 0
Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 10.0
Relative Humidity: 60
Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0
Nitrogen (After blade): 1
```

This recommendation combines the parameters that have shown the strongest positive correlation with high elastic modulus values, while pushing the concentration to the upper limit of the typical range to potentially achieve even higher modulus values.",74.82276309333224,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the provided experimental data, I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment that should maximize the elastic modulus.

## Analysis of Current Data

The highest elastic modulus values observed were:
- 277.39 bar (Index 68): 17% concentration, no heating, not mixed, 0 rest days, 0 min wait time, 50% RH
- 272.22 bar (Index 56): 17% concentration, no heating, not mixed, 0 rest days, 10 min wait time, 58% RH, nitrogen after blade
- 219.62 bar (Index 55): 17% concentration, no heating, not mixed, 0 rest days, 10 min wait time, 68% RH, nitrogen after blade
- 211.51 bar (Index 54): 17% concentration, no heating, not mixed, 0 rest days, 10 min wait time, 68% RH, nitrogen after blade

## Key Patterns

1. Higher concentration (17%) consistently produces higher modulus
2. No heating appears beneficial for higher modulus
3. Not mixing the solution (False for ""Mixed"") correlates with higher modulus
4. 0 rest days appears optimal
5. Longer coupon-to-bath wait times (10 min) with nitrogen after blade shows good results
6. Relative humidity around 50-68% seems favorable

## Recommended Next Experiment

Based on these observations, I recommend the following parameters:

- Auto: True
- Heating: False
- Concentration: 20.0 (pushing to upper limit of range)
- Heating Block Temperature: 25
- Mixed: False
- Rest Time (days): 0
- Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 10.0
- Relative Humidity: 55
- Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0
- Nitrogen (After blade): 1

This combination leverages the highest concentration within range, optimal processing conditions observed in the best-performing samples, and includes the nitrogen after blade feature that appears in several high-modulus results.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
