Based on the single data point provided (Experiment ID 12), I'll recommend parameters for the next experiment that are likely to maximize the elastic modulus.

## Recommended Experimental Parameters

- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 15.0% polysulfone (increased from 10.0%)
- **Solution Preparation**:
  - Heating: Yes
  - Heating block temperature: 60°C
  - Mixed: Yes (robot-mixed)
  - Rest time: 1 day (reduced from 2 days)

## Casting Conditions
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2.0 minutes (increased from 0.0 minutes)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (decreased from 56%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale

1. **Increased polymer concentration** (15% vs 10%): Higher polymer concentrations typically lead to denser membrane structures with improved mechanical properties.

2. **Added heating during preparation**: Heating improves polymer dissolution and creates more homogeneous solutions, potentially leading to more uniform membrane structures with better mechanical properties.

3. **Reduced rest time** (1 day vs 2 days): Optimizing the rest time can help achieve the right balance between solution homogeneity and viscosity.

4. **Added wait time before immersion** (2 minutes): This controlled delay allows partial solvent evaporation, forming a denser skin layer that can improve mechanical strength.

5. **Lower humidity** (40% vs 56%): Controlling humidity can affect the phase separation kinetics, with lower humidity potentially slowing the initial phase separation for more controlled structure formation.

6. **Added nitrogen flow**: Nitrogen flow creates a more controlled atmosphere during casting, potentially improving uniformity and mechanical properties.

These parameter adjustments aim to create a more controlled phase separation process, leading to a membrane with higher elastic modulus.",220.5104016857166,296.35081017123304,Continuing

The key differences appear to be:

1. Higher polymer concentration (16.0% vs 10.0%)
2. Shorter rest time (1 day vs 2 days)
3. Use of nitrogen flow from the side during drop casting (Yes vs No)
4. Similar relative humidity (54% vs 56%)

For the next experiment to maximize modulus, I recommend:

## Recommended Next Experiment
- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from 16.0% as higher concentration appears beneficial)
- **Heating**: Yes (introduce heating to potentially improve polymer dissolution)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 40°C (moderate heating)
- **Mixed**: Yes (continue with automated mixing)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (maintain the successful shorter rest period)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 min (maintain immediate immersion)
- **Relative Humidity**: 50% (slightly lower than previous experiments)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (maintain this beneficial parameter)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (add this parameter to potentially improve uniformity)

This recommendation builds on the successful parameters from Experiment #30 while strategically adjusting key variables that may further enhance the modulus based on polymer membrane formation principles.",162.77817832797786,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three experiments reported, I can identify trends that suggest how to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Analysis of Previous Results:
- Experiment #12: 10.0% concentration, no heating, 2 days rest, 56% RH, no nitrogen → 39.59 bar modulus
- Experiment #23: 16.0% concentration, no heating, 1 day rest, 49% RH, no nitrogen → 162.78 bar modulus
- Experiment #30: 16.0% concentration, no heating, 1 day rest, 54% RH, nitrogen from side → 220.51 bar modulus

## Key Observations:
1. Higher polymer concentration (16% vs 10%) significantly increases modulus
2. Using nitrogen flow from the side during drop casting appears beneficial
3. Moderate humidity (54%) with nitrogen flow produced the highest modulus
4. Shorter rest time (1 day vs 2 days) may be preferable

## Recommended Next Experiment:
- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from 16% to explore upper range)
- **Heating**: Yes (to aid dissolution of higher concentration)
- **Heating block temperature**: 40°C (moderate heating)
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest time**: 1 day
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 50-55% (target 52%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (adding this parameter to potentially further improve modulus)

This experiment builds on the successful conditions from Experiment #30 while strategically exploring higher concentration and additional nitrogen flow to maximize the elastic modulus.",207.09310351510177,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0%
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature of 25°C)
- **Mixed**: Yes (automatically mixed by robotic system)
- **Rest time**: 1 day
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 54%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

## Rationale
1. **Higher polymer concentration**: The data shows a clear trend where higher polymer concentrations (16% in Exp #30 and #23) yielded much higher modulus values (220.51 and 162.78 bar) compared to lower concentration (10% in Exp #12 with only 39.59 bar). Increasing to 18% may further improve modulus.

2. **Nitrogen flow during drop-casting**: Experiments #29 and #30 both used nitrogen flow from the side during drop-casting and achieved high modulus values (207.09 and 220.51 bar respectively).

3. **Optimal humidity**: Maintaining relative humidity around 54% appears beneficial, as seen in experiments #29 and #30 which achieved the highest modulus values.

4. **1-day rest time**: Both high-performing experiments (#23, #29, #30) used a 1-day rest time rather than 2 days.

5. **Immediate immersion**: All experiments used immediate immersion (0.0 min wait time), which appears to be optimal.

This parameter combination builds upon the most successful conditions observed while pushing the polymer concentration higher to potentially achieve even greater modulus values.",140.76871335709305,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I'll analyze the patterns to recommend parameters that are likely to maximize the elastic modulus.

## Analysis of Previous Results:

- Experiment #71: 15.0% concentration, no heating, 1 day rest, 50% RH, no nitrogen → 140.77 bar modulus

## Key Patterns:
1. Higher polymer concentration (14-16%) correlates with higher modulus
2. 1 day rest time appears optimal
3. Nitrogen flow during drop casting significantly improves modulus
4. ~54% relative humidity appears favorable
5. All successful experiments used automated synthesis with no heating

## Rationale:
I'm recommending increasing the polymer concentration to 18% since there appears to be a positive correlation between concentration and modulus (from 10% to 16%). The highest modulus was achieved at 16%, so exploring a slightly higher concentration may yield further improvements while staying within reasonable processing limits.

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus values (220.51 and 207.09 bar) were observed in experiments with 16% and 14% polymer concentration respectively, both using side nitrogen flow during drop-casting.

2. A consistent pattern shows that higher polymer concentrations (14-16%) yield significantly higher modulus values compared to lower concentrations (10-12%).

3. All high-performing experiments used a 1-day rest time rather than longer periods.

4. Immediate immersion in the NIPS bath (0.0 min wait time) appears optimal across all experiments.

5. The relative humidity around 54% appears to be associated with the highest modulus values.

6. Side nitrogen flow during drop-casting appears to be beneficial for achieving higher modulus values, as seen in experiments #29 and #30.

7. No heating during mixing appears to be preferable for maximizing modulus.

This recommendation aims to replicate the conditions of experiment #30 (which achieved the highest modulus of 220.51 bar) while ensuring all parameters remain within the established ranges.",28.08588319590436,296.35081017123304,Continuing

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.2 minutes (12 seconds)
- **Relative Humidity**: 65%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale:
1. **Higher polymer concentration**: The data shows a strong positive correlation between polymer concentration and modulus. Experiments with 16-17% concentration (Exp #30, #23, #50) yielded the highest modulus values (220.51, 162.78, 197.84 bar). Increasing to 18% should further improve modulus.

2. **No heating**: The experiments with highest modulus values did not use heating during preparation.

3. **Premixed solution**: Experiment #50 with a premixed solution showed excellent results (197.84 bar).

4. **Minimal rest time**: Zero rest time in Experiment #50 produced high modulus, suggesting immediate use may be beneficial.

5. **Short wait time**: A brief wait time (0.17-0.2 min) before immersion appears beneficial compared to immediate immersion.

6. **Controlled humidity**: Moderate-high humidity (65-70%) seems to produce better results than very low or very high humidity.

7. **Dual nitrogen flow**: Using nitrogen flow both during drop casting and after blade casting should provide optimal humidity control throughout the process, combining the benefits seen in experiments #29, #30, and #50.

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 8.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 60%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale:
1. **Polymer Concentration**: The highest modulus values (224.57, 272.22 bar) were observed with 17% concentration. I'm recommending a slight increase to 18% to explore if higher concentration further improves modulus.

2. **Wait Time**: Experiment #56 with the highest modulus (272.22 bar) used a 10-minute wait time. I'm recommending 8 minutes to optimize between this high value and other successful experiments with shorter wait times.

3. **Premixed Solution**: The top-performing experiments (#50, #51, #56) all used premixed solutions without robotic mixing.

4. **No Rest Time**: The highest modulus values were consistently achieved with no solution rest time (0 days).

5. **Nitrogen Flow Pattern**: Applying nitrogen after blade casting but not during side-drop appears optimal based on the highest modulus experiment (#56).

6. **Relative Humidity**: Moderately high humidity (58-70%) appears beneficial, with the best results around 58-60%.

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 58-60%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus observed (272.22 bar) was in experiment #56, which used 17% concentration, 10 minutes wait time, and nitrogen after blade casting.

2. Higher polymer concentrations (16-17%) consistently produced higher modulus values compared to lower concentrations (10-14%).

3. Premixed solutions appear to perform better than robot-mixed solutions.

4. Longer coupon-to-bath wait times (especially 10 minutes) showed significant improvement in modulus compared to immediate immersion.

5. Applying nitrogen flow after blade casting but not during side drop appears optimal for controlling humidity exposure during the critical membrane formation period.

6. No heating during preparation and no solution rest time were associated with the highest modulus values.

16,57,Index: 53; Auto: True; Heating: False; Concentration: 17.0; Heating Block Temperature: 25; Mixed: False; Rest Time (days): 0; Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time (min): 10.0; Relative Humidity: 68; Nitrogen (Side from drop): 0; Nitrogen (After blade): 0,"# Recommendation for Next Experiment to Maximize Modulus

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Recommended Experiment Parameters
- **Auto**: Yes (fully automated process)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from the highest observed value of 17.0%)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature of 25°C)
- **Mixed**: No (use premixed solution)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately after preparation)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 60%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. **Higher polymer concentration (18.0%)**: The highest modulus values (224.57, 272.22, 219.62 bar) were observed with 17.0% concentration. Increasing to 18.0% may further enhance mechanical properties.

2. **No heating**: Experiments without heating consistently showed higher modulus values compared to those with heating.

3. **Premixed solution**: Experiments using premixed solutions (rather than robot-mixed) showed superior modulus values.

4. **Zero rest time**: The highest modulus values were observed when solutions were used immediately after preparation.

5. **Extended wait time (10.0 minutes)**: Experiment #56 with 10-minute wait time showed the highest modulus (272.22 bar).

6. **Moderate humidity (60%)**: The best results occurred in the 58-70% humidity range.

7. **Nitrogen after blade only**: Applying nitrogen flow after blade casting but not during side drop appears optimal for maximizing modulus.

This parameter combination builds upon the conditions that produced the highest modulus values in the dataset while making a strategic increase in polymer concentration to potentially achieve even higher mechanical properties.",296.35081017123304,296.35081017123304,Max modulus reached
