Based on the single data point provided (Experiment ID 12), I'll recommend parameters that are likely to increase the elastic modulus for your next membrane synthesis experiment.

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment:
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated (Yes)
- **Polymer Concentration**: 15% polysulfone (increased from 10%)
- **Heating**: Yes (apply heating during mixing)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 60°C
- **Mixed**: Yes (robot-mixed)
- **Rest Time**: 1 day (reduced from 2 days)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 2 minutes (increased from 0 minutes)
- **Relative Humidity**: 40% (reduced from 56%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale:
1. **Higher polymer concentration** (15% vs 10%) typically leads to denser membrane structures with higher mechanical strength
2. **Heating during mixing** can improve polymer dissolution and distribution
3. **Shorter rest time** (1 day vs 2 days) may prevent potential polymer aggregation
4. **Adding a short wait time** before immersion allows partial solvent evaporation, creating a skin layer that can enhance mechanical properties
5. **Lower humidity** can control the rate of phase separation
6. **Adding nitrogen flow** during and after casting can help control the initial phase separation process

This recommendation aims to create a more controlled phase separation process that should yield a membrane with higher modulus compared to your initial experiment.",220.5104016857166,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two experimental observations provided, I can see that Experiment #30 achieved a significantly higher modulus (220.51) compared to Experiment #12 (39.59). The key differences that likely contributed to this improvement include:

## Recommended Parameters for Next Experiment:

1. **Concentration**: 18.0% polysulfone (increasing from 16.0% in Exp #30)
   - Higher polymer concentration appears to correlate with higher modulus

2. **Heating**: Yes (introduce heating during mixing)
   - Temperature: 40°C for heating block

3. **Mixed**: Yes (use robotic mixing system)

4. **Rest time**: 1 day
   - The 1-day rest time in Exp #30 was more effective than 2 days in Exp #12

5. **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 min
   - Immediate immersion worked well in both experiments

6. **Relative Humidity**: 50% 
   - Control at slightly lower than previous experiments

7. **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
   - This was used in the higher-modulus Exp #30

8. **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes
   - Adding this parameter may further improve results

9. **Auto**: Yes (fully automated process)

## Rationale:
The higher polymer concentration (18% vs 16%) should further increase the modulus based on the trend observed. Adding heating during mixing may improve polymer dissolution and solution homogeneity. Maintaining the nitrogen flow from the side during drop casting while adding nitrogen flow after blade casting could provide better control of the phase separation process, potentially leading to improved mechanical properties.",207.09310351510177,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three experiments reported, I can identify trends that suggest how to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Key Observations
1. Higher polymer concentration correlates with higher modulus:
   - 10.0% concentration → 39.59 MPa modulus (Exp #12)
   - 14.0% concentration → 207.09 MPa modulus (Exp #29)
   - 16.0% concentration → 220.51 MPa modulus (Exp #30)

2. Nitrogen flow from the side during drop-casting appears beneficial:
   - No nitrogen flow → 39.59 MPa (Exp #12)
   - With nitrogen flow → 207.09 MPa and 220.51 MPa (Exp #29 and #30)

## Recommended Next Experiment

I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment:

- **Concentration**: 18.0% (increasing from previous maximum of 16.0%)

- **Rest time**: 1 day
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 0.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 50%

## Rationale
1. **Concentration**: The highest modulus values (220.51 and 207.09) were observed with higher polymer concentrations (16.0% and 14.0%). Increasing to 18.0% may further enhance mechanical properties.

2. **Rest time**: A 1-day rest period was consistent across the experiments with higher modulus values.

3. **Nitrogen flow during drop-casting**: The experiments with nitrogen flow from the side during drop-casting (Experiments #29 and #30) showed significantly higher modulus values compared to Experiment #12 without nitrogen flow.

4. **Relative humidity**: The experiments with moderate humidity (49-54%) showed better results than the higher humidity experiment (56%).

5. **Immediate immersion**: All successful experiments used immediate immersion (0.0 min wait time), suggesting this is optimal.

This parameter set builds upon the successful conditions from previous experiments while pushing the concentration higher to potentially achieve even greater mechanical strength.",140.76871335709305,296.35081017123304,Continuing

1. The highest modulus observed (220.51) was with 16% concentration, but experiment #51 with 17% concentration showed excellent modulus (168.33) with very low standard deviation.

2. Manual premixing appears beneficial - experiment #51 used manual premixing and achieved high modulus with exceptional consistency.

3. Zero rest time was used in experiment #51, which performed well, suggesting immediate use may be advantageous.

4. A 1-minute coupon-to-bath wait time appears optimal based on experiment #51, compared to immediate immersion in other experiments.

5. Higher relative humidity (70%) combined with nitrogen flow after blade casting appears to create favorable conditions for high modulus formation.

6. The combination of high concentration (17%), controlled humidity exposure (nitrogen after blade), and brief wait time (1 minute) appears to create optimal conditions for membrane formation with high modulus.

2. **Wait Time**: The experiment with the highest modulus (272.22) used a 10-minute wait time before bath immersion, significantly longer than most other experiments.

3. **Nitrogen Flow**: Applying nitrogen after blade casting but not during side-drop appears optimal based on experiments #56 and #50, which showed high modulus values.

5. **No Rest Time**: The top-performing experiments (#50, #51, #56) all used solutions with no rest time.

   - No rest time
   - Longer wait times (10 minutes) before bath immersion
   - Nitrogen flow after blade casting

2. Polymer concentration appears to be a critical factor, with higher concentrations (16-17%) consistently yielding higher modulus values compared to lower concentrations (10-14%).

3. The extended coupon-to-bath wait time (10 minutes) appears to significantly improve modulus compared to immediate immersion (0 minutes).

4. Applying nitrogen flow after blade casting but not during side-drop appears optimal for controlling humidity exposure during the critical membrane formation period.

5. I've suggested a relative humidity of 60-65%, which is between the values used in experiments #56 (58%) and #55 (68%), both of which produced excellent results.
