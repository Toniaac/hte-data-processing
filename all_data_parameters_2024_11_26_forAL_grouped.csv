The polymer solution (10% w/w polysulfone in PolarClean solvent) was prepared using the automated mixing function without heating (ambient temperature of 25??C). After preparation, the solution was allowed to rest for 3 days in a sample vial to ensure complete dissolution and homogeneity.

The membrane casting was performed at 55% relative humidity. The polymer solution was automatically drop-cast onto the substrate and then blade-cast to form a uniform film. No nitrogen gas flow was applied either during the drop-casting or after blade-casting processes. Immediately following blade-casting (0 minutes wait time), the cast film was immersed in the non-solvent bath to initiate phase separation and membrane formation.

## Experiment #21

A polysulfone membrane was synthesized using non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) with the following parameters:

The polymer solution was prepared with 12.0% polysulfone concentration in PolarClean solvent. The solution was automatically mixed by the robotic system at room temperature (25??C) without additional heating. After preparation, the solution was rested in a sample vial for 1 day before casting.

The membrane was cast using the automated system. Immediately after blade casting (0.0 min wait time), the sample was immersed in the NIPS bath. The synthesis was conducted at 49% relative humidity without nitrogen gas flow either at the side during drop casting or after blade casting.

This experiment represents one condition in a systematic study of membrane formation parameters using an automated robotic synthesis platform."

The experiment utilized our robotic system for membrane synthesis. A premixed polysulfone solution (17.0% concentration in PolarClean) was used without additional heating or mixing by the robot. The solution was used immediately after preparation (0 days rest time). The polymer solution was drop-cast onto the substrate and blade-cast without nitrogen protection. The cast film was immediately immersed in the non-solvent bath (0.0 minutes wait time) to induce phase separation. All processing was conducted at ambient temperature (25??C) without heating.

## Notes
This experiment represents a fully automated membrane synthesis process using premixed polymer solution under standard conditions without environmental controls (no nitrogen protection) at relatively high humidity."
