## Composition Analysis
The sample consists of pure FAPbI₃ perovskite with no CsPbI₃ or MAPbI₃ content. The instability index is measured at 480,185.0.

## Discussion of Structural and Chemical Properties

### A-site Cation Characteristics
Formamidinium (FA⁺) is a relatively large organic cation with a molecular structure of HC(NH₂)₂⁺. This size affects the following properties:

1. **Tolerance Factor**: The large FA⁺ cation likely produces a tolerance factor near the upper boundary of stability for the perovskite structure, potentially causing lattice strain.

2. **Hydrogen Bonding**: FA⁺ forms hydrogen bonds with the surrounding iodide ions in the inorganic framework, which can influence structural dynamics.

3. **Rotational Freedom**: The FA⁺ cation exhibits significant rotational freedom within the inorganic cage, contributing to lattice flexibility but potentially reducing structural stability.

### Phase Stability Considerations
Pure FAPbI₃ is known to exhibit polymorphism:

1. **Phase Transitions**: FAPbI₃ can exist in multiple phases, with the black perovskite α-phase (desired for photovoltaics) being metastable at room temperature.

2. **δ-Phase Tendency**: Pure FAPbI₃ has a thermodynamic preference to transform to the yellow non-perovskite δ-phase under ambient conditions, which may contribute to the high instability index.

### Chemical Stability Factors

1. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The absence of more hydrophobic cations (like Cs⁺) may increase vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation.

2. **Thermal Considerations**: While FA⁺-based perovskites generally show better thermal stability than MA⁺-based ones, the pure composition lacks the stabilizing effect of inorganic cations.

## Implications for Long-term Stability

The high instability index (480,185.0) likely reflects the structural and chemical vulnerabilities of pure FAPbI₃. The absence of compositional engineering through cation mixing (particularly the lack of Cs⁺ which could stabilize the perovskite phase) may be a significant factor contributing to this instability.

For improved stability, strategies such as partial A-site substitution with Cs⁺ or other cations, surface passivation, or dimensional engineering could be considered in future formulations.","Report: # Experimental Report: Stability Analysis of FAPbI₃ Perovskite

## Discussion
The sample represents a pure formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI₃) perovskite without any cesium or methylammonium cation incorporation. This composition has several structural and chemical implications:

### Structural Considerations
1. FAPbI₃ typically forms a black α-phase (perovskite structure) with favorable optoelectronic properties, but it can readily transform to a yellow δ-phase (non-perovskite) at room temperature.
2. The FA⁺ cation (HC(NH₂)₂⁺) is larger than both Cs⁺ and MA⁺ cations, resulting in a larger cuboctahedral void in the lead-iodide framework.
3. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor for pure FAPbI₃ is close to the upper limit for stable perovskite formation, potentially contributing to phase instability.

### Chemical Considerations
1. The FA⁺ cation contains N-H bonds that can interact with moisture, potentially accelerating degradation pathways.
2. Pure FAPbI₃ lacks the stabilizing effect of smaller cations (like Cs⁺) that can help maintain the perovskite phase.
3. The absence of mixed cations eliminates potential entropy-driven stabilization effects that are typically observed in mixed-cation systems.

### Stability Implications
The high instability index (505657.0) likely reflects the known phase instability of pure FAPbI₃. This instability may manifest as:
- Spontaneous phase transitions from the photoactive black phase to the non-photoactive yellow phase
- Increased susceptibility to moisture-induced degradation
- Potential thermal instability under operating conditions

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following compositional ratio:
- CsPbI₃: 25%
- FAPbI₃: 75% 
- MAPbI₃: 0%

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

The examined perovskite represents a binary Cs/FA mixed-cation system with complete absence of the MA cation. This composition merits analysis regarding its potential stability characteristics.

### Cation Size Effects
The formamidinium (FA) cation is larger (radius ~2.53 Å) than both cesium (Cs, ~1.81 Å) and methylammonium (MA, ~2.17 Å). The predominance of FA (75%) in this composition likely influences the tolerance factor, potentially causing lattice strain due to the size mismatch between Cs and FA cations.

### Hydrogen Bonding Considerations
FA cations can form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding iodide ions in the perovskite framework. The absence of MA, which typically forms stronger hydrogen bonds, may affect the structural rigidity of the crystal lattice.

### Phase Stability
Pure CsPbI₃ typically exists in a non-photoactive yellow δ-phase at room temperature, while FAPbI₃ tends to transform to a yellow δ-phase under ambient conditions. The mixing ratio (25:75) may not provide sufficient stabilization of the desired black α-phase.

### Moisture and Thermal Sensitivity
The high FA content may increase susceptibility to moisture-induced degradation, as FA-rich compositions typically show higher hygroscopicity compared to Cs-rich variants. However, the inclusion of Cs (25%) could provide some enhancement to thermal stability compared to pure FAPbI₃.

## Conclusion

The analyzed composition (25% CsPbI₃, 75% FAPbI₃) presents a structure that may face stability challenges due to the predominance of the larger FA cation and absence of MA. This composition likely represents a compromise between the thermal stability offered by Cs and the favorable optoelectronic properties of FA, but may not achieve optimal phase stability under ambient conditions.

1.0,0.0,0.0,144556,"CsPbI: 1.0, FAPbI: 0.0, MAPbI: 0.0, Instability index: 144556.0","# Experimental Report: Stability Analysis of CsPbI₃ Perovskite

## Composition Analysis
The sample consists of pure CsPbI₃ perovskite with no FA⁺ or MA⁺ cation incorporation (CsPbI₃:FAPbI₃:MAPbI₃ = 1.0:0.0:0.0). The instability index was measured at 144556.0.

## Structural Considerations
CsPbI₃ adopts a perovskite structure with Cs⁺ occupying the A-site position. The relatively small ionic radius of Cs⁺ (1.67 Å) compared to FA⁺ (2.53 Å) and MA⁺ (2.17 Å) results in a lower tolerance factor, which affects the structural stability of the perovskite phase.

## Stability Analysis
The high instability index observed can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Phase Transition Tendency**: Pure CsPbI₃ is known to readily transform from the photoactive black α-phase (perovskite) to the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase (non-perovskite) at room temperature.

2. **Tolerance Factor**: The Goldschmidt tolerance factor for CsPbI₃ falls at the lower boundary of stability for perovskite structures, making it inherently less stable than mixed-cation formulations.

3. **Lattice Strain**: The smaller Cs⁺ cation creates octahedral tilting in the PbI₆ framework, introducing strain that may contribute to instability.

## Implications
The absence of organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺) eliminates potential degradation pathways related to organic component volatility or decomposition. However, this advantage is outweighed by the inherent structural instability of the pure CsPbI₃ composition.

For improved stability, future formulations should consider:
- Partial substitution with larger A-site cations to optimize the tolerance factor
- Incorporation of mixed halides to tune lattice parameters
- Surface passivation strategies to kinetically inhibit phase transitions","Report: # Experimental Report: Stability Analysis of CsPbI₃ Perovskite

The sample consists of pure CsPbI₃ perovskite with no FA⁺ or MA⁺ cation incorporation (CsPbI₃:FAPbI₃:MAPbI₃ = 1.0:0.0:0.0). The instability index was measured at 144556.0.

## Structural Considerations
CsPbI₃ adopts a perovskite structure with Cs⁺ occupying the A-site position. The relatively small ionic radius of Cs⁺ (1.67 Å) compared to FA⁺ (2.53 Å) and MA⁺ (2.17 Å) results in a lower tolerance factor, which affects the structural stability of the perovskite phase.

## Stability Analysis
The high instability index observed can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Phase Transition Tendency**: Pure CsPbI₃ is known to readily transform from the photoactive black α-phase (perovskite) to the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase (non-perovskite) at room temperature.

2. **Tolerance Factor**: The Goldschmidt tolerance factor for CsPbI₃ falls at the lower boundary of stability for perovskite structures, making it inherently less stable than mixed-cation formulations.

3. **Lattice Strain**: The smaller Cs⁺ cation creates octahedral tilting in the PbI₆ framework, introducing strain that may contribute to instability.

## Implications
The absence of organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺) eliminates potential degradation pathways related to organic component volatility or decomposition. However, this advantage is outweighed by the inherent structural instability of the pure CsPbI₃ composition.

For improved stability, future formulations should consider:
- Partial substitution with larger A-site cations to optimize the tolerance factor
- Incorporation of mixed halides to tune lattice parameters
- Surface passivation strategies to kinetically inhibit phase transitions

## Structural Considerations
CsPbI₃ adopts a perovskite structure with Cs⁺ occupying the A-site position. The tolerance factor for CsPbI₃ is relatively low (~0.8) due to the smaller ionic radius of Cs⁺ (1.67 Å) compared to organic cations like FA⁺ and MA⁺.

## Stability Analysis
The high instability index observed can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Phase Instability**: Pure CsPbI₃ is known to readily transform from the photoactive black phase (α-phase) to the non-photoactive yellow phase (δ-phase) at room temperature due to its low tolerance factor.

2. **Structural Distortion**: The smaller Cs⁺ cation creates octahedral tilting in the PbI₆ framework, reducing structural stability.

3. **Absence of Hydrogen Bonding**: Unlike organic cations (FA⁺, MA⁺), Cs⁺ cannot form hydrogen bonds with the iodide ions, which would otherwise enhance structural stability.

## Implications
The pure CsPbI₃ composition demonstrates significant instability challenges that would likely manifest as:
- Rapid phase segregation
- Poor moisture resistance
- Limited thermal stability
- Reduced operational lifetime in devices

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample has the following A-site cation distribution:
- Cs⁺: 0.0 (0%)
- FA⁺ (formamidinium): 0.75 (75%)
- MA⁺ (methylammonium): 0.25 (25%)

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### Phase Stability
The absence of Cs⁺ is notable as cesium typically contributes to structural stability in mixed-cation perovskites. The predominance of FA⁺ (75%) may lead to phase instability issues, as pure FAPbI₃ naturally forms a yellow hexagonal δ-phase at room temperature rather than the photoactive black α-phase.

### Tolerance Factor
The relatively large FA⁺ cation combined with the smaller MA⁺ cation likely produces a tolerance factor near the upper stability limit for the perovskite structure. Without the smaller Cs⁺ to balance the average A-site cation size, the crystal structure may experience lattice strain.

### Moisture Sensitivity
The high proportion of organic cations (100% combined FA⁺ and MA⁺) suggests significant vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation. Both FA⁺ and MA⁺ are hygroscopic, with MA⁺ being particularly susceptible to humidity-driven decomposition.

### Thermal Stability
The thermal stability is likely compromised by the significant MA⁺ content (25%), as MA⁺ is known to volatilize at relatively low temperatures (~85°C). While FA⁺ offers better thermal stability than MA⁺, the absence of inorganic Cs⁺ may limit the overall thermal resilience of the composition.

### Ion Migration
The composition may be susceptible to ion migration, particularly of the organic cations, which could lead to phase segregation under operational conditions such as light exposure or applied bias.

## Conclusion
The high instability index (914156.0) likely correlates with the absence of Cs⁺ stabilization and the dominance of organic cations. For improved stability, incorporation of Cs⁺ and potential reduction in MA⁺ content could be beneficial.

2. **Phase Segregation Risk**: The binary composition without FA⁺ may be susceptible to phase segregation, particularly under thermal or light stress, as the two cations have different coordination preferences with the surrounding iodide framework.

3. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The MA⁺ component (25%) introduces hygroscopic character to the material. The N-H bonds in MA⁺ can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, potentially accelerating degradation pathways in humid conditions.

4. **Thermal Considerations**: Pure CsPbI₃ typically exhibits better thermal stability than MAPbI₃, but the mixed composition may not fully capitalize on this advantage due to potential interfacial instabilities between the different cation domains.

5. **Octahedral Tilting**: The smaller Cs⁺ cation may induce octahedral tilting in the PbI₆ framework, affecting the overall symmetry and potentially creating localized strain that could serve as degradation initiation points.

## Conclusion

The high instability index correlates with structural and chemical vulnerabilities in this Cs/MA mixed cation perovskite. The absence of the formamidinium (FA⁺) cation, which often serves as a stabilizing intermediate-sized cation in triple-cation formulations, may contribute to the observed instability.

## Structural and Chemical Analysis

The analyzed perovskite represents a binary mixed-cation system with cesium as the predominant A-site cation. This composition exhibits several notable structural features that may influence its stability:

1. **Cation Size Effects**: Cs⁺ (ionic radius ~1.67 Å) is smaller than MA⁺ (methylammonium, ~2.17 Å), which affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The high Cs⁺ content likely results in a tolerance factor closer to the lower boundary of stability for the perovskite phase.

2. **Lattice Distortion**: The size mismatch between Cs⁺ and MA⁺ may introduce lattice strain and octahedral tilting in the PbI₆ framework, potentially creating structural vulnerabilities.

3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: The MA⁺ cation can form hydrogen bonds with the iodide ions in the lattice, while Cs⁺ cannot. The limited hydrogen bonding (due to only 25% MA⁺) may reduce structural reinforcement.

4. **Phase Segregation Risk**: Binary mixtures of cations with significant size differences may be prone to phase segregation under thermal or environmental stress.

5. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The high Cs⁺ content may reduce hygroscopicity compared to pure MA-based perovskites, but the presence of MA⁺ still introduces some vulnerability to moisture.

The high instability index (128971.0) suggests significant potential for degradation. This may be attributed to:

- Suboptimal tolerance factor from the Cs-dominant composition
- Limited hydrogen bonding network due to low organic cation content
- Possible phase segregation under operational conditions
- Potential for CsPbI₃ to transition to the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase

The absence of FA⁺ (formamidinium) is notable, as FA⁺ often contributes to improved thermal stability in mixed-cation systems.

- Formamidinium (FA⁺): 25% 
- Methylammonium (MA⁺): 50%

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

The high instability index (446747.0) observed in this mixed-cation perovskite may be attributed to several factors related to its composition:

The dominant presence of MA⁺ (50%) likely contributes significantly to the instability. Methylammonium is known to be thermally volatile and susceptible to degradation under environmental stressors such as heat and humidity. Its smaller ionic radius (2.17 Å) compared to FA⁺ (2.53 Å) creates structural distortions in the perovskite lattice.

The equal proportions of Cs⁺ and FA⁺ (25% each) may not provide sufficient lattice stabilization. While Cs⁺ typically enhances thermal stability due to its inorganic nature, its relatively small ionic radius (1.81 Å) can lead to octahedral tilting when not optimally balanced with larger cations.

## Potential Stability Mechanisms

The Goldschmidt tolerance factor for this mixed composition likely falls outside the optimal range for structural stability. The combination of differently sized A-site cations creates lattice strain and potential phase segregation pathways under environmental stress.

The relatively high MA⁺ content may facilitate moisture ingress and subsequent degradation through hydrogen bonding interactions between the amine groups and water molecules, potentially explaining the high instability index.

## Discussion of Compositional Effects on Stability

The mixed-cation approach employed in this sample represents a common strategy to balance structural stability with optoelectronic performance. Each cation contributes distinct properties to the overall perovskite structure:

Cesium (Cs⁺), with its smaller ionic radius, typically enhances structural stability by reducing lattice distortion. However, pure CsPbI₃ tends to form a non-photoactive yellow phase at room temperature.

Formamidinium (FA⁺) offers a more optimal band gap for photovoltaic applications but suffers from phase instability at room temperature, often converting to a non-perovskite hexagonal yellow phase.

Methylammonium (MA⁺), which constitutes half of the A-site cations in this sample, provides good optoelectronic properties but is vulnerable to thermal degradation and moisture sensitivity due to its volatile nature.

The relatively high proportion of MA⁺ (50%) may be a contributing factor to the observed instability index. MA⁺ is known to be susceptible to deprotonation and volatilization under environmental stressors, potentially creating vacancies in the crystal structure that accelerate degradation pathways.

## Stability Considerations

The Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which depends on the effective ionic radii of the constituent ions, is likely affected by this specific cation distribution. The combination of differently sized A-site cations (Cs⁺ < MA⁺ < FA⁺) creates a complex structural environment that may influence octahedral tilting and overall structural rigidity.

The high MA⁺ content may compromise long-term stability under operational conditions, particularly when exposed to elevated temperatures, humidity, or prolonged illumination.

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

The analyzed perovskite consists predominantly of methylammonium (MA) cations (75%) with a smaller fraction of formamidinium (FA) cations (25%) and no cesium (Cs) content. This composition may influence several key properties:

### Structural Considerations
The absence of Cs⁺ cations, which have a smaller ionic radius compared to MA⁺ and FA⁺, likely affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor of the perovskite structure. The predominance of MA⁺ cations, which are smaller than FA⁺ cations, may create a structure with moderate distortion in the lead-iodide octahedral framework.

### Chemical Stability Factors
1. **Thermal stability**: The high MA⁺ content may limit thermal stability, as MA⁺ is known to be more volatile and prone to degradation at elevated temperatures compared to FA⁺ and Cs⁺.

2. **Moisture sensitivity**: MA-rich compositions typically exhibit higher sensitivity to moisture, potentially leading to hydrate formation and subsequent degradation.

3. **Phase stability**: The absence of Cs⁺, which can help stabilize the black phase of FAPbI₃, may result in reduced phase stability, potentially allowing undesirable phase transitions.

### Potential Stability Improvement Strategies
Based on the composition analysis, the following modifications could be considered to potentially improve stability:

1. Introduction of Cs⁺ cations to create a triple-cation system

- MA⁺ is known to be more volatile and susceptible to thermal degradation than Cs⁺
- The hydrogen bonding network between the organic cations and the inorganic framework will be dominated by MA⁺ interactions
- The absence of Cs⁺, which typically enhances moisture resistance, may leave the structure more vulnerable to humidity-induced degradation

The examined perovskite represents a binary mixed-cation system with cesium and methylammonium as A-site cations in the ABX₃ perovskite structure. The high instability index (876981.0) suggests significant structural vulnerabilities that warrant examination.

### Key Observations:

1. **Cation Size Effects**: The significant size mismatch between Cs⁺ (ionic radius ~1.67 Å) and MA⁺ (~2.17 Å) may create lattice distortions. Without the intermediate-sized FA⁺ cation (~2.53 Å) to buffer these differences, the crystal structure likely experiences strain.

The sample consists of a pure methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI₃) perovskite with no cesium or formamidinium components (CsPbI₃: 0.0, FAPbI₃: 0.0, MAPbI₃: 1.0).

## Structural and Chemical Analysis
MAPbI₃ adopts a tetragonal crystal structure at room temperature with the methylammonium (MA⁺) cation occupying the A-site of the ABX₃ perovskite framework. The relatively small size of the MA⁺ cation (effective ionic radius ~217 pm) results in a tolerance factor that allows perovskite formation but may not provide optimal structural stability.

## Stability Considerations
The pure MAPbI₃ composition presents several inherent stability challenges:

1. **Thermal Instability**: The MA⁺ cation is volatile and can readily decompose at elevated temperatures (>85°C), leading to the formation of PbI₂ and release of methylammonium iodide.

2. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The hygroscopic nature of the MA⁺ cation makes the structure highly susceptible to moisture ingress, facilitating hydrate formation and subsequent decomposition.

3. **Phase Instability**: MAPbI₃ undergoes phase transitions at various temperatures, which can induce mechanical stress and degradation during thermal cycling.

4. **Ion Migration**: The structure allows for significant halide ion migration, particularly under illumination or applied bias, which can lead to compositional heterogeneity over time.

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite represents a binary Cs/FA mixed-cation system with complete absence of the MA cation. The dominance of FA⁺ (formamidinium) cations in the A-site position likely influences the crystal structure in several ways:

1. **Tolerance Factor**: FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (253 pm) compared to Cs⁺ (167 pm), resulting in a tolerance factor closer to unity for FAPbI₃. The mixed composition may help optimize the overall tolerance factor toward the ideal cubic structure.

2. **Crystal Phase**: Pure FAPbI₃ typically crystallizes in a yellow δ-phase at room temperature, which is photoinactive. The incorporation of 16% Cs⁺ likely helps stabilize the black α-phase needed for optoelectronic performance.

### Chemical Stability Considerations

1. **Thermal Stability**: The absence of MA⁺ is potentially beneficial for thermal stability, as MA⁺ is known to be thermally labile due to its volatile nature. Cs⁺ incorporation generally enhances thermal resilience.

2. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The high FA⁺ content may contribute to moisture sensitivity, as FAPbI₃ is generally less stable against humidity than CsPbI₃. The relatively high instability index may reflect this vulnerability.

3. **Phase Segregation Risk**: The binary system may experience less phase segregation than ternary systems, though the significant disparity between Cs⁺ and FA⁺ concentrations could still lead to compositional heterogeneity over time.

## Potential Stability Implications

The relatively high instability index (57484.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This may be attributed to:

1. The dominant presence of FA⁺, which tends to form a less stable perovskite structure compared to pure Cs⁺-based compositions.

2. Insufficient Cs⁺ content to fully stabilize the photoactive black phase of the perovskite.

- Potential for hydrogen bonding that can influence structural cohesion
- Generally better optoelectronic properties compared to pure Cs-based perovskites

## Stability Considerations

Several factors may influence the stability of this composition:

1. **Tolerance Factor**: The mixed Cs/FA composition likely yields a tolerance factor closer to the ideal value than either pure composition alone, potentially enhancing structural stability.

2. **Phase Segregation**: The binary system may be susceptible to phase segregation under environmental stressors, particularly given the significant difference in cation sizes.

3. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The absence of MA may reduce hygroscopic tendencies, but the FA component remains susceptible to moisture-induced degradation.

The examined perovskite represents a triple-cation system with formamidinium (FA⁺) as the dominant A-site cation, supplemented by cesium (Cs⁺) and a minimal amount of methylammonium (MA⁺). This compositional strategy likely aims to balance structural stability with optoelectronic performance.

### Structural Considerations
The high FA⁺ content (0.69) provides favorable tolerance factors for the perovskite structure while potentially offering good absorption properties. However, pure FAPbI₃ typically exhibits phase instability at room temperature, tending to transform from the photoactive black α-phase to the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase.

The substantial Cs⁺ incorporation (0.3) likely serves to stabilize the crystal structure through:
1. Reduced lattice distortion due to the smaller ionic radius of Cs⁺ compared to FA⁺
2. Enhanced resistance to moisture-induced degradation
3. Suppression of phase segregation

The minimal MA⁺ content (0.01) suggests an intentional reduction of this cation, which is known to be thermally unstable and susceptible to volatilization under operational conditions.

### Chemical Stability Implications
The high instability index (190636.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This could be attributed to:

1. Possible incomplete phase stabilization despite the Cs⁺ addition
2. Potential ion migration pathways within the crystal structure
3. Residual strain at grain boundaries due to mixed-cation composition

The very low MA⁺ content may be insufficient to provide its beneficial effects on crystallization kinetics while still introducing a potential degradation pathway.

The substantial Cs⁺ incorporation (0.3) likely serves to stabilize the crystal structure. Cesium, with its smaller ionic radius, can reduce lattice strain and potentially suppress phase segregation. Previous literature suggests that Cs⁺ inclusion can enhance thermal stability and reduce halide segregation under operational conditions.

The minimal MA⁺ content (0.01) suggests an intentional reduction of this cation, which is known to be vulnerable to thermal and moisture degradation due to its volatile nature.

### Stability Implications
The high instability index (342685.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term operational stability. This could be attributed to several factors:

1. The dominant FA⁺ content may still permit phase transitions under certain environmental conditions.
2. Despite Cs⁺ incorporation, the specific ratio may not be optimal for stabilizing the particular composition.
3. Even the small MA⁺ content could contribute to degradation pathways, particularly under elevated temperatures or humidity.

## Conclusion
The analyzed triple-cation perovskite composition demonstrates a strategic approach to balance performance and stability through cation engineering. The high FA⁺ content paired with significant Cs⁺ incorporation represents an attempt to maintain favorable optoelectronic properties while enhancing structural stability. However, the high instability index suggests that this particular compositional ratio may require further optimization to achieve long-term operational stability for practical applications.

- CsPbI₃: 0.87
- FAPbI₃: 0.12
- MAPbI₃: 0.01
- Reported instability index: 224858.0

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The sample is predominantly composed of CsPbI₃ (87%), with minor contributions from FAPbI₃ (12%) and trace amounts of MAPbI₃ (1%). This composition represents a mixed-cation approach where the A-site of the ABX₃ perovskite structure contains three different cations (Cs⁺, FA⁺, and MA⁺) while maintaining the same lead-iodide (PbI₃⁻) framework.

The high Cs⁺ content is notable as pure CsPbI₃ typically exhibits the δ-phase (yellow phase) at room temperature, which is non-photoactive. The incorporation of larger organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺) likely aims to stabilize the photoactive α-phase (black phase) through tuning of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor.

### Chemical Stability Implications
1. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The low content of hygroscopic MA⁺ (1%) may reduce moisture sensitivity compared to traditional MAPbI₃ perovskites, but the material would still require encapsulation for long-term stability.

2. **Thermal Stability**: The high Cs⁺ content should enhance thermal stability, as CsPbI₃ has superior thermal properties compared to organic-cation perovskites. However, phase transitions remain a concern.

3. **Phase Segregation Risk**: The multi-cation approach may face challenges with cation segregation under operational conditions, particularly given the significant compositional imbalance (87:12:1).

4. **Halide Migration**: While not directly indicated by the composition, the all-iodide framework may experience halide migration under illumination and applied bias, potentially creating defect sites.

## Discussion of Compositional Effects on Properties and Stability

The examined perovskite represents a mixed-cation composition with formamidinium (FA) as the dominant A-site cation. This compositional profile may influence several key properties:

### Structural Considerations
The high FA content (0.85) likely determines the primary structural characteristics. FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (253 pm) compared to Cs⁺ (167 pm) and MA⁺ (217 pm), which affects the tolerance factor and octahedral tilting in the perovskite structure. The relatively low Cs⁺ content (0.13) may be insufficient to fully stabilize the cubic phase, potentially allowing phase segregation under environmental stress.

### Thermal Stability
The minimal MA⁺ content (0.02) is beneficial for thermal stability, as MA⁺ is known to be thermally labile. However, the dominant FA⁺ component may still present volatility concerns at elevated temperatures, though less pronounced than MA-rich compositions.

### Moisture Sensitivity
FA-dominant perovskites typically show intermediate moisture sensitivity. The low Cs⁺ incorporation may not provide sufficient protection against humidity-induced degradation, as Cs⁺ typically enhances moisture resistance through stronger ionic bonding.

### Phase Stability
The composition contains a relatively low proportion of Cs⁺, which is often used to stabilize the photoactive black phase of perovskites. The high FA⁺ content may lead to phase instability, as pure FAPbI₃ naturally tends toward a non-photoactive hexagonal phase at room temperature.

## Results and Discussion

The examined perovskite demonstrates a predominantly FA-based composition with significant Cs incorporation and minimal MA content. This compositional profile may influence stability through several mechanisms:

The high FA⁺ content (64%) provides good optoelectronic properties but may contribute to phase instability, as pure FAPbI₃ typically exhibits a phase transition from the photoactive black phase (α) to a non-photoactive yellow phase (δ) under ambient conditions.

The substantial Cs⁺ incorporation (34%) likely serves to stabilize the crystal structure through its smaller ionic radius (compared to FA⁺), which can reduce lattice strain and potentially suppress phase segregation.

The inclusion of Cs⁺ (28%) likely serves to improve structural stability through its smaller ionic radius, which can help adjust the Goldschmidt tolerance factor toward more stable values.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The relatively low proportion of MAPbI₃ (7%) may be beneficial for stability, as the methylammonium cation is known to be susceptible to thermal degradation and moisture-induced decomposition. However, the high FAPbI₃ content could present challenges regarding phase stability, as pure FAPbI₃ tends to transition to a non-perovskite δ-phase under ambient conditions.

### Potential Stability Implications

### Structural Considerations
The sample is predominantly composed of CsPbI₃ (91%), which features the inorganic cesium cation. This high Cs⁺ content likely influences the crystal structure significantly. Cs⁺ has a smaller ionic radius (1.67 Å) compared to the organic cations FA⁺ (2.53 Å) and MA⁺ (2.17 Å), which may affect the tolerance factor and octahedral tilting within the perovskite framework.

The minimal incorporation of FA⁺ (1%) suggests limited contribution of this larger organic cation to the structural properties. The moderate inclusion of MA⁺ (8%) may provide some intermediate structural characteristics between the predominantly inorganic framework and a fully organic-cation system.

### Chemical Stability Considerations
The high Cs⁺ content could impart certain stability advantages:
- Reduced susceptibility to humidity-induced degradation compared to MA-rich compositions
- Enhanced thermal stability due to the inorganic nature of Cs⁺
- Potentially improved resistance to phase segregation

However, pure CsPbI₃ typically exhibits phase instability at room temperature, preferring to adopt a non-perovskite yellow phase (δ-phase) rather than the photoactive black phase (α-phase). The small amounts of MA⁺ and FA⁺ may be insufficient to fully stabilize the photoactive phase.

### Potential Factors Contributing to the Instability Index

1. Insufficient mixed-cation stabilization effect due to the low FA⁺ content
2. Potential phase segregation between Cs-rich and MA-rich domains

## Discussion of Compositional Effects on Properties and Stability

The examined perovskite represents a triple-cation system with FA⁺ as the dominant A-site cation. This compositional distribution may influence several key material properties:

### Structural Considerations
The relatively high FA⁺ content (0.66) likely contributes to favorable lattice parameters, as FA⁺ has an intermediate ionic radius between the smaller MA⁺ and larger Cs⁺ ions. The incorporation of 0.23 Cs⁺ may help stabilize the cubic phase by reducing lattice distortion through the Goldschmidt tolerance factor optimization.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The moderate Cs⁺ content could enhance moisture resistance compared to pure FAPbI₃ or MAPbI₃ compositions. However, the relatively low proportion of MA⁺ (0.11) may be insufficient to fully benefit from its potential stabilizing effects on the crystal structure.

### Thermal Stability Implications
The significant FA⁺ fraction may improve thermal stability compared to MA⁺-rich compositions, as FA⁺ is less prone to thermal degradation. The Cs⁺ component should further enhance thermal resilience by strengthening the lattice through its higher charge density.

### Phase Stability Considerations
The triple-cation approach generally aims to suppress phase segregation and the formation of non-photoactive phases (particularly the yellow δ-phase in FAPbI₃). The current ratio may not provide optimal phase stabilization, potentially contributing to the observed instability index.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following compositional ratios:
- CsPbI₃: 0.23
- FAPbI₃: 0.66
- MAPbI₃: 0.11

## Discussion of Compositional Effects on Properties and Stability

The examined perovskite represents a triple-cation system with FA⁺ as the dominant A-site cation. This compositional distribution may influence several key material properties:

### Structural Considerations
The relatively high FA⁺ content (0.66) likely contributes to favorable lattice parameters, as FA⁺ has an intermediate ionic radius between the smaller MA⁺ and larger Cs⁺ ions. The incorporation of 0.23 Cs⁺ may help stabilize the cubic phase by reducing lattice distortion through the Goldschmidt tolerance factor optimization.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The moderate Cs⁺ content could enhance moisture resistance compared to pure FAPbI₃ or MAPbI₃ compositions. However, the relatively low proportion of MA⁺ (0.11) may be insufficient to fully benefit from its potential stabilizing effects on the crystal structure.

### Thermal Stability Implications
The significant FA⁺ fraction may improve thermal stability compared to MA⁺-rich compositions, as FA⁺ is less prone to thermal degradation. The Cs⁺ component should further enhance thermal resilience by strengthening the lattice through its higher charge density.

### Phase Stability Considerations
The triple-cation approach generally aims to suppress phase segregation and the formation of non-photoactive phases (particularly the yellow δ-phase in FAPbI₃). The current ratio may not provide optimal phase stabilization, potentially contributing to the observed instability index.

## Conclusion
The compositional profile of this perovskite suggests a material that balances the beneficial properties of each cation but may not achieve optimal stability. Further optimization of the cation ratios, particularly increasing the Cs⁺ content while maintaining sufficient FA⁺, could potentially improve the stability metrics of this material.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following composition:
- CsPbI₃: 89%
- MAPbI₃: 11%
- FAPbI₃: 0%

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### Cation Size Effects
The sample is predominantly composed of CsPbI₃ with a minor fraction of MAPbI₃. The Cs⁺ cation (ionic radius ~1.67 Å) is significantly smaller than the MA⁺ cation (methylammonium, ~2.17 Å). This size disparity may introduce lattice strain at the interfaces between CsPbI₃ and MAPbI₃ domains.

### Phase Stability
Pure CsPbI₃ typically forms a yellow non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature, which is photoinactive. The incorporation of 11% MA⁺ cations may help stabilize the black perovskite α-phase to some extent, but the absence of FA⁺ (formamidinium) cations, which typically enhance phase stability, is notable.

### Moisture Sensitivity
The MA⁺ component introduces potential vulnerability to moisture degradation due to its hygroscopic nature. While the high Cs⁺ content may improve thermal stability, it may not sufficiently counteract the moisture sensitivity contributed by MA⁺.

### Ion Migration Considerations
The mixed-cation structure may experience ion migration under operational conditions, particularly at the interfaces between different compositional domains. The absence of FA⁺ eliminates a cation that typically helps reduce ion migration.

## Potential Stability Implications
The high instability index (481313.0) suggests significant concerns regarding long-term stability. This may be attributed to:
1. Potential phase segregation between Cs-rich and MA-rich domains
2. Insufficient stabilization of the photoactive perovskite phase
3. Vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation

## Composition
The perovskite sample has the following composition:
- CsPbI₃: 89%
- MAPbI₃: 11%
- FAPbI₃: 0%

## Structural and Chemical Analysis

The analyzed perovskite consists predominantly of cesium-based CsPbI₃ with a minor component of methylammonium-based MAPbI₃. This composition presents several notable structural features that may influence stability:

### Cation Size Effects
The Cs⁺ cation (ionic radius ~1.67 Å) is significantly smaller than the MA⁺ cation (~2.17 Å). This size mismatch could create lattice distortions at the interfaces between CsPbI₃ and MAPbI₃ domains, potentially introducing strain within the crystal structure.

### Tolerance Factor Considerations
The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) for CsPbI₃ is lower than ideal (~0.8), which predicts a tendency toward the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase rather than the desired black α-phase. The addition of 11% MA⁺ may slightly improve the tolerance factor but likely remains suboptimal for structural stability.

### Phase Segregation Risk
The absence of FA⁺ cations, which typically help stabilize mixed-cation formulations, may increase the risk of phase segregation between the Cs-rich and MA-rich domains, particularly under thermal or humidity stress.

### Potential Degradation Pathways
The MA⁺ component introduces C-N bonds susceptible to degradation under heat, light, and humidity. While the relatively low MA⁺ content (11%) reduces this vulnerability compared to pure MAPbI₃, it still represents a potential degradation pathway not present in pure inorganic CsPbI₃.

## Conclusion

The high CsPbI₃ content suggests an attempt to leverage the thermal stability of inorganic cations, while the small MA⁺ fraction may be intended to improve the tolerance factor and phase stability. However, the complete absence of FA⁺ and the relatively high instability index suggest this particular composition may face challenges in long-term operational stability.

The varying ionic radii of these cations (Cs⁺ < MA⁺ < FA⁺) likely influence the overall tolerance factor of the perovskite structure. The combination may create lattice strain due to size mismatch between the different cations occupying the A-site position.

### Chemical Stability Factors
1. **Hygroscopic Properties**: The relatively low MA⁺ content (12%) is potentially beneficial, as methylammonium is highly hygroscopic and susceptible to moisture degradation.

2. **Thermal Stability**: The significant Cs⁺ content (34%) may enhance thermal stability, as CsPbI₃ typically exhibits better resistance to thermal degradation than organic-cation perovskites.

3. **Phase Stability**: The high FA⁺ content (54%) could contribute to phase instability, as pure FAPbI₃ tends to transition to a non-photoactive δ-phase at room temperature.

- Suppress phase segregation
- Reduce defect formation
- Create a more robust crystal structure through entropic stabilization

## Discussion of Compositional Effects on Properties and Stability

The examined perovskite represents a mixed-cation system with cesium (Cs⁺) as the predominant A-site cation. This compositional profile may influence several material properties relevant to stability:

### Structural Considerations
The high Cs⁺ content (78%) likely influences the crystal structure significantly. Cs⁺ has a smaller ionic radius compared to the organic cations FA⁺ and MA⁺, which could affect the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. This predominance of Cs⁺ may induce lattice contraction and potentially affect phase stability at room temperature.

### Chemical Considerations
The relatively low organic cation content (22% combined FA⁺ and MA⁺) may reduce susceptibility to degradation mechanisms typically associated with organic components, such as:
- Reduced vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation
- Potentially improved thermal stability due to lower volatile organic content
- Decreased susceptibility to UV-induced degradation of organic components

Cs⁺ has a smaller ionic radius (1.67 Å) compared to MA⁺ (2.17 Å) and FA⁺ (2.53 Å), which affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The predominance of Cs⁺ may lead to increased octahedral tilting in the PbI₆ framework, potentially causing phase instability.

The absence of FA⁺ is notable, as FA⁺ typically contributes to improved thermal stability in mixed-cation perovskites. Without this component, the material may exhibit reduced thermal resilience.

The relatively high instability index (456,484.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This could manifest as:

1. Phase segregation between Cs-rich and MA-rich domains
2. Vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation
3. Potential thermal instability at elevated temperatures
4. Possible light-induced ion migration

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following composition:
- CsPbI₃: 83%
- MAPbI₃: 17%
- FAPbI₃: 0%

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

The high instability index (374938.0) observed in this Cs-MA mixed cation perovskite likely stems from several structural and chemical factors:

The predominant CsPbI₃ component typically crystallizes in a non-photoactive yellow δ-phase at room temperature due to the small ionic radius of Cs⁺ (1.67 Å), which results in a low tolerance factor. While the black α-phase of CsPbI₃ is photoactive, it is thermodynamically unstable under ambient conditions.

The incorporation of 17% MAPbI₃ introduces the methylammonium (MA⁺) cation, which has a larger ionic radius than Cs⁺ but is hygroscopic and thermally unstable. MA⁺ is particularly susceptible to degradation via:
- Moisture-induced decomposition
- Thermal degradation at moderate temperatures (>85°C)
- Volatilization of organic components

## Stability Implications

The absence of formamidinium (FA⁺) in this composition is notable, as FA⁺ typically enhances thermal stability compared to MA⁺. The complete lack of FA⁺ may contribute to the high instability index.

The Cs-MA mixture appears insufficient to stabilize the photoactive black phase of the perovskite structure under ambient conditions. The mismatch between the ionic radii of Cs⁺ and MA⁺ may create lattice strain and defects that serve as degradation initiation sites.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following compositional ratio:
- CsPbI₃: 81%
- MAPbI₃: 19%
- FAPbI₃: 0%

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### Cation Size Effects
The sample is predominantly composed of CsPbI₃ with a smaller fraction of MAPbI₃. The Cs⁺ cation (ionic radius ~1.67 Å) is significantly smaller than the MA⁺ cation (methylammonium, ~2.17 Å). This size disparity may introduce lattice strain at the interfaces between CsPbI₃ and MAPbI₃ domains.

### Phase Stability
Pure CsPbI₃ typically forms a yellow non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature, which is photoinactive. The incorporation of 19% MA⁺ cations may help stabilize the black perovskite α-phase by increasing the tolerance factor. However, the absence of FA⁺ (formamidinium) cations, which typically enhance structural stability, could be a limiting factor.

### Moisture and Thermal Sensitivity
The MA⁺ cation is known to be vulnerable to moisture and thermal degradation due to its organic nature and volatility. While the high Cs⁺ content may improve thermal stability, the presence of MA⁺ could still create pathways for moisture ingress and degradation.

### Ion Migration Considerations
The mixed cation composition may affect ion migration pathways. The different sizes of Cs⁺ and MA⁺ could create interstitial spaces that facilitate halide migration, potentially leading to phase segregation over time.

## Stability Implications
The high instability index (376516.0) suggests significant potential for degradation. This may be attributed to:
1. Possible phase segregation between Cs-rich and MA-rich domains

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### A-site Cation Effects
The sample consists predominantly of formamidinium (FA) cations with a small fraction of cesium (Cs) cations and no methylammonium (MA) cations. This composition creates a mixed A-site cation perovskite with the following implications:

1. **Tolerance Factor**: FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (253 pm) compared to Cs⁺ (167 pm), resulting in a tolerance factor closer to unity for the FA-rich composition. This generally favors the formation of a cubic perovskite structure.

2. **Phase Stability**: Pure FAPbI₃ typically exhibits polymorphism between the photoactive black α-phase (perovskite) and the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase (non-perovskite). The incorporation of 9% Cs⁺ likely aims to stabilize the α-phase through entropic effects.

3. **Hydrogen Bonding**: FA⁺ contains N-H groups capable of hydrogen bonding with the iodide ions in the inorganic framework, which can influence structural rigidity. The absence of MA⁺ eliminates its characteristic stronger hydrogen bonding patterns.

## Stability Considerations

1. **Thermal Stability**: The high FA⁺ content may provide better thermal stability compared to MA-based compositions, as FA⁺ has higher thermal decomposition temperature. However, the relatively low Cs⁺ content might be insufficient to fully suppress phase transitions at elevated temperatures.

2. **Moisture Sensitivity**: FA-rich compositions typically show moderate hygroscopicity. The limited Cs⁺ incorporation may not provide sufficient protection against moisture-induced degradation, potentially leading to hydrate formation upon exposure to humidity.

### Cation Size Effects
The sample contains a binary mixture of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius, ~1.67 Å) and FA⁺ (larger ionic radius, ~2.53 Å) cations, with complete absence of MA⁺ (~2.17 Å). This composition creates a heterogeneous A-site cation distribution that likely affects the tolerance factor of the perovskite structure.

### Tolerance Factor Implications
The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) for this mixed composition would be influenced by the weighted average of the constituent cations. The FA-rich composition (68%) would tend to increase the tolerance factor, potentially pushing it closer to the ideal value of 1, while the Cs component (32%) would counterbalance this effect. This combination may help stabilize the cubic phase of the perovskite.

### Potential Stability Factors

## Discussion of Structural and Chemical Properties

### Dominant Cs⁺ Cation Influence
The high proportion of Cs⁺ cations (96%) will significantly influence the perovskite's properties. Cesium has a smaller ionic radius (1.67 Å) compared to formamidinium (FA⁺, 2.53 Å), which affects the tolerance factor of the perovskite structure. The Cs-dominant composition likely results in:

1. **Reduced Octahedral Tilting**: The smaller Cs⁺ cation may cause increased tilting of the PbI₆ octahedra, potentially leading to a non-cubic phase at room temperature.

2. **Phase Stability Considerations**: Pure CsPbI₃ typically exhibits the yellow δ-phase (non-perovskite) at room temperature rather than the desired black α-phase (perovskite), which could impact stability.

### Minor FA⁺ Incorporation
The small amount (4%) of FA⁺ cations may:

1. **Partially Counteract Octahedral Distortion**: The larger FA⁺ cation could slightly alleviate the octahedral tilting caused by Cs⁺, potentially improving phase stability.

2. **Introduce Lattice Strain**: The size mismatch between Cs⁺ and FA⁺ may create local strain in the crystal lattice.

1. **Thermal Degradation Pathways**: MA⁺ is known to be thermally unstable and prone to volatilization at elevated temperatures.

2. **Hydrogen Bonding Effects**: MA⁺ typically forms hydrogen bonds with the iodide ions, which affects structural dynamics.

## Stability Considerations

1. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The predominantly inorganic nature (Cs⁺-based) may provide better resistance to humidity compared to organic-cation-rich compositions, though all iodide-based perovskites remain somewhat moisture-sensitive.

2. **Thermal Stability**: The absence of volatile MA⁺ and limited FA⁺ content should enhance thermal stability compared to organic-cation-rich compositions.

## Structural and Stability Considerations

The predominance of FA⁺ (83%) in this composition is noteworthy. FA-based perovskites typically exhibit favorable optoelectronic properties but can suffer from phase instability. The relatively high instability index (284939.0) observed may be related to this FA-dominant composition.

The inclusion of Cs⁺ (16%) likely serves as a stabilizing agent. Cesium, with its smaller ionic radius compared to organic cations, can help improve structural stability by reducing lattice strain. However, the current proportion may be insufficient to fully stabilize the FA-rich structure.

The minimal MA⁺ content (1%) suggests this composition aims to reduce the presence of the most volatile cation. MA⁺ is known to be susceptible to thermal degradation and moisture sensitivity, so its limited inclusion is consistent with stability-focused design principles.

## Potential Stability Factors

Several factors may contribute to the observed instability:

1. **Phase segregation risk**: The high FA⁺ content may lead to phase segregation under operational conditions, particularly at elevated temperatures.

2. **Goldschmidt tolerance factor**: The current cation distribution may result in a tolerance factor that deviates from the optimal range for stable cubic perovskite structure.

3. **Halide migration**: While not directly measured, the all-iodide composition may exhibit higher ion migration tendencies compared to mixed-halide systems.

2. Explore partial substitution of iodide with bromide to potentially enhance structural stability.

3. Investigate the addition of 2D passivation layers or surface treatments to mitigate degradation pathways.

Further characterization including XRD analysis, thermal stability testing, and humidity exposure studies would be valuable to fully understand the stability limitations of this composition.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following A-site cation distribution:
- Cs⁺: 17%
- FA⁺ (formamidinium): 82% 
- MA⁺ (methylammonium): 1%

## Structural and Stability Considerations

### Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor
The observed composition combines cations of different ionic radii (Cs⁺ < MA⁺ < FA⁺), which would affect the overall tolerance factor of the perovskite structure. The predominance of FA⁺ (82%) suggests a tolerance factor closer to that of pure FAPbI₃, which typically exhibits a value slightly above the ideal range, potentially causing structural distortions.

### Phase Stability
The high FA⁺ content may predispose the material to phase instability issues. Pure FAPbI₃ is known to undergo phase transitions between the photoactive α-phase (black) and the non-photoactive δ-phase (yellow) at room temperature. The incorporation of 17% Cs⁺ likely aims to stabilize the α-phase through lattice contraction, though the relatively low concentration may be insufficient for complete stabilization.

### Chemical Stability
The minimal MA⁺ content (1%) reduces vulnerability to degradation pathways associated with methylammonium, such as volatilization and moisture-induced decomposition. However, the high FA⁺ proportion maintains susceptibility to humidity-related degradation mechanisms.

### Ion Migration
The mixed-cation composition may influence ion migration pathways within the perovskite structure. The significant size difference between Cs⁺ and FA⁺ could create local lattice strains that potentially facilitate ion movement, particularly at defect sites or grain boundaries.

## Conclusion
The analyzed composition (Cs₀.₁₇FA₀.₈₂MA₀.₀₁)PbI₃ represents a mixed-cation approach to perovskite formulation with a strong emphasis on FA⁺. The high instability index (227835.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability, likely stemming from the dominant FA⁺ content.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following A-site cation distribution:
- Cs⁺: 37%
- FA⁺ (formamidinium): 62%
- MA⁺ (methylammonium): 1%

## Structural and Stability Considerations

The observed composition represents a predominantly Cs/FA mixed-cation perovskite with minimal MA content. This compositional profile may influence stability through several mechanisms:

1. **Tolerance Factor Effects**: The incorporation of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius) alongside FA⁺ (larger ionic radius) likely modulates the Goldschmidt tolerance factor toward a more stable range. The minimal MA⁺ content suggests an intentional reduction of this less stable cation.

2. **Phase Stabilization**: Pure FAPbI₃ typically exhibits a yellow non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature, while pure CsPbI₃ tends toward a yellow orthorhombic phase. The mixed composition likely aims to stabilize the black perovskite α-phase through entropic effects.

3. **Moisture Resistance**: The significant Cs⁺ content may enhance moisture resistance compared to pure organic-cation perovskites, as Cs⁺ is less hygroscopic than FA⁺ or MA⁺.

4. **Thermal Stability**: The low MA⁺ content (1%) suggests an attempt to minimize the presence of the thermally volatile methylammonium cation, potentially improving thermal stability.

## Potential Stability Limitations

The high instability index (180293.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This could be attributed to:

1. **Phase Segregation Risk**: Mixed-cation systems may experience phase segregation under operational conditions, particularly with this Cs/FA ratio.

2. **Interfacial Reactivity**: The iodide-based composition may promote reactivity with common electrode materials or moisture ingress at interfaces.

3. **Halide Migration**: All-iodide compositions typically exhibit significant halide ion migration under electric fields, potentially leading to compositional heterogeneity over time.

The perovskite sample under investigation has the following compositional ratios:
- CsPbI₃: 0.70
- FAPbI₃: 0.29

## Discussion of Structural and Chemical Properties

### Cation Size Effects
The sample contains a predominant fraction of Cs⁺ cations (0.70), which have a smaller ionic radius (1.67 Å) compared to the organic cations FA⁺ (2.53 Å) and MA⁺ (2.17 Å). This size distribution likely influences the Goldschmidt tolerance factor of the perovskite structure, which is a critical parameter for phase stability.

### Structural Considerations
The high Cs⁺ content may promote a more compact crystal structure with potentially stronger Pb-I interactions. However, pure CsPbI₃ is known to readily transform from the photoactive black phase (α-phase) to a non-photoactive yellow phase (δ-phase) under ambient conditions. The incorporation of 29% FA⁺ may help mitigate this phase instability by increasing the tolerance factor toward more favorable values.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The minimal MA⁺ content (1%) is noteworthy, as methylammonium is typically the least stable cation under thermal and humidity stress due to its volatility and hygroscopic nature. The low MA⁺ concentration suggests an intentional design choice to reduce degradation pathways associated with this cation.

### Potential Stability Implications

1. The dominant Cs⁺ fraction potentially promoting phase segregation
2. Possible lattice strain from accommodating different-sized cations
3. Incomplete suppression of the α-to-δ phase transition in the CsPbI₃ component

The analyzed composition represents a mixed-cation approach with a strong preference for inorganic Cs⁺ cations supplemented by FA⁺. While this strategy reduces reliance on the less stable MA⁺ cation, the high instability index suggests that this particular ratio may not achieve optimal phase stability.

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite is predominantly composed of formamidinium (FA) cations with minor contributions from cesium (Cs) and methylammonium (MA) cations. This composition creates a mixed-cation structure that likely influences the material's tolerance factor and octahedral tilting behavior.

The high FA content (84%) is notable as FAPbI₃ typically exhibits a larger cation size compared to both Cs and MA. While this can be beneficial for bandgap tuning, pure FAPbI₃ is known to have phase stability issues at room temperature, often transitioning to a non-photoactive δ-phase.

### Structural Considerations
The predominance of FA⁺ cations (76%) in the A-site position likely influences the crystal structure significantly. FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (253 pm) compared to both Cs⁺ (167 pm) and MA⁺ (217 pm), which affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The high FA⁺ content may promote a more cubic-like structure, potentially beneficial for optoelectronic properties.

The relatively low Cs⁺ content (18%) may be insufficient to fully stabilize the crystal lattice against phase transitions. Cesium typically enhances structural rigidity and thermal stability in mixed-cation perovskites.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following compositional ratios:
- CsPbI₃: 0.18 (18%)
- FAPbI₃: 0.76 (76%)
- MAPbI₃: 0.06 (6%)
- Measured instability index: 140574.0

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The predominance of FA⁺ cations (76%) in the A-site position likely influences the crystal structure significantly. FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (253 pm) compared to both Cs⁺ (167 pm) and MA⁺ (217 pm), which affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The high FA⁺ content may promote a more cubic-like structure, potentially beneficial for optoelectronic properties.

The relatively low Cs⁺ content (18%) may be insufficient to fully stabilize the crystal lattice against phase transitions. Cesium typically enhances structural rigidity and thermal stability in mixed-cation perovskites.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The minimal MA⁺ content (6%) is noteworthy, as methylammonium is generally considered the least stable of the three cations due to its volatility and susceptibility to degradation under heat and moisture. However, even this small percentage could potentially contribute to instability pathways.

The high FA⁺ content may present challenges, as formamidinium-based perovskites are prone to phase transitions between the photoactive α-phase and the non-photoactive δ-phase, particularly under environmental stressors.

### Potential Stability Implications
The high instability index (140574.0) suggests potential structural or chemical vulnerabilities. This could manifest as:

1. Phase segregation under operational conditions
2. Susceptibility to moisture-induced degradation
3. Thermal instability at elevated temperatures
4. Potential ion migration under applied electric fields

## Conclusion
The perovskite composition is predominantly FA-based with moderate Cs incorporation and minimal MA content. The high instability index suggests that this particular compositional ratio may face stability challenges. Further investigation into phase behavior under various environmental conditions would be valuable to understand the specific degradation mechanisms and to develop appropriate stabilization strategies.

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite is predominantly composed of formamidinium (FA) cations, with smaller proportions of cesium (Cs) and methylammonium (MA) cations. This mixed-cation approach is consistent with current strategies to optimize perovskite properties through compositional engineering.

The high FA content (79%) likely influences the crystal structure significantly. FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (2.53 Å) compared to MA⁺ (2.17 Å) and Cs⁺ (1.81 Å), which affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The FA-dominant composition may promote a more cubic crystal structure, potentially beneficial for optoelectronic properties but possibly challenging for stability.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The relatively high instability index (59256.0) suggests potential concerns regarding long-term stability. Several compositional factors may contribute to this:

1. **Hygroscopic Nature**: FA and MA cations are both organic and hygroscopic, making them susceptible to moisture degradation. The high combined organic cation content (87%) may increase moisture sensitivity.

2. **Thermal Considerations**: FA-based perovskites typically exhibit better thermal stability than MA-based ones, but the low Cs content (13%) may be insufficient to fully stabilize the structure against phase transitions at elevated temperatures.

3. **Ion Migration**: The composition may influence ion migration pathways, particularly for iodide ions, which could affect long-term operational stability under electric fields.

### Potential Optimization Strategies
Based on the compositional analysis, several approaches could be considered to improve stability:

1. Increasing the Cs⁺ content to enhance structural rigidity and moisture resistance
2. Partial substitution of iodide with bromide to improve structural stability
3. Introduction of 2D/3D interfaces through addition of larger organic cations to suppress ion migration

## Conclusion
The analyzed perovskite composition features a FA-dominant structure with minor Cs and MA components.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The relatively high instability index (272,660.0) suggests potential vulnerability to degradation pathways. Several compositional factors may contribute to this:

1. The high FA content, while beneficial for bandgap tuning and absorption properties, may introduce instability due to the organic cation's susceptibility to thermal and moisture-induced degradation.

2. The low Cs⁺ content (6%) may be insufficient to adequately suppress phase instability. Cesium is typically incorporated to improve thermal stability and reduce phase segregation.

3. The presence of MA⁺ (9%), while modest, introduces an additional organic component susceptible to degradation, particularly under elevated temperatures or humidity.

### Potential Stability Implications
The composition suggests a material that may exhibit:
- Good optoelectronic properties due to the FA-dominant composition
- Potential phase instability under thermal stress due to limited Cs⁺ content
- Possible vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation pathways

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following A-site cation distribution:
- Cs⁺: 66% 
- FA⁺ (formamidinium): 24%
- MA⁺ (methylammonium): 10%

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### Tolerance Factor Effects
The mixed-cation composition likely produces a more favorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor compared to single-cation systems. The relatively high Cs⁺ content (66%) provides structural rigidity due to its smaller ionic radius, while the organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺) contribute to a more flexible lattice arrangement.

### Phase Stability
The high Cs⁺ content may promote the formation of the black α-phase rather than the undesirable yellow δ-phase often observed in pure CsPbI₃. The inclusion of FA⁺ and MA⁺ likely suppresses phase segregation by increasing the configurational entropy of the system.

### Moisture Resistance
The significant proportion of inorganic Cs⁺ (66%) should enhance moisture resistance compared to purely organic-cation perovskites, as Cs⁺ is less hygroscopic than MA⁺ and FA⁺. However, the presence of 34% organic cations may still render the material somewhat susceptible to moisture-induced degradation.

### Thermal Stability
The high Cs⁺ content is expected to improve thermal stability, as Cs⁺ is non-volatile compared to MA⁺, which can readily degrade at elevated temperatures. The moderate FA⁺ content (24%) should also contribute positively to thermal stability.

## Instability Index Interpretation
The reported instability index of 476197.0 is notably high, suggesting potential stability challenges despite the compositional engineering. This may indicate that:

1. The specific ratio of cations may not be optimized for the PbI₃⁻ framework
2. Other factors beyond composition (e.g., defects, grain boundaries) may be contributing to instability
3. The high Cs⁺ content might induce lattice strain due to size mismatch with the lead-iodide framework

While the high Cs⁺ content should theoretically enhance stability against moisture and thermal degradation, the high instability index suggests that this particular composition may not represent an optimal balance for long-term stability.

The high instability index (489801.0) suggests potential structural challenges. This could be attributed to several factors:

1. The imbalanced cation distribution may create lattice strain due to the significant size difference between Cs⁺ and the organic cations.
2. The predominantly Cs-based composition might favor the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase rather than the desired black α-phase.
3. The limited FA⁺ content may be insufficient to provide the stabilizing effects typically observed in triple-cation formulations.

## Implications for Long-term Stability

Based on compositional analysis alone, this perovskite formulation may face stability challenges related to:

- Phase segregation due to the disparate cation sizes
- Potential moisture sensitivity from the MA⁺ component
- Possible thermal instability under operational conditions
- Limited structural flexibility due to high Cs⁺ content

Further experimental investigation including XRD analysis, thermal stability testing, and humidity exposure would be necessary to fully characterize the stability profile of this specific composition.

## Composition Analysis
The mixed-cation perovskite under investigation has the following composition:
- CsPbI₃: 26%
- FAPbI₃: 37% 
- MAPbI₃: 36%
- Total A-site cation ratio: 99% (minor deviation likely due to rounding)

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### A-site Cation Effects
The perovskite contains three different A-site cations with varying ionic radii: Cs⁺ (smallest), MA⁺ (intermediate), and FA⁺ (largest). This mixed-cation approach typically influences:

1. **Tolerance Factor**: The relatively balanced distribution between the three cations may help optimize the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, potentially improving structural stability.

2. **Phase Stability**: Pure CsPbI₃ tends to form a non-photoactive yellow δ-phase at room temperature, while the incorporation of larger cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺) can help stabilize the photoactive black α-phase.

3. **Crystallization Dynamics**: The presence of multiple cations likely affects nucleation and crystal growth processes during film formation.

### Potential Stability Concerns

The high instability index (252642.0) suggests significant vulnerability to degradation, which may be attributed to:

1. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The relatively high proportion of organic cations (MA⁺ and FA⁺, totaling 73%) may increase hygroscopic behavior, making the material susceptible to moisture-induced degradation.

2. **Thermal Instability**: MA⁺ is known to be thermally unstable and can volatilize at moderate temperatures, potentially leading to compositional changes over time.

3. **Phase Segregation**: The multi-cation system may experience phase segregation under operational conditions, particularly given the significant proportion of each component.

4. **Halide Migration**: While the composition indicates a pure iodide system, iodide ions are highly mobile and may contribute to defect formation and ion migration under electric fields.

## Conclusions

The mixed-cation composition represents a balanced approach to perovskite formulation, incorporating the stabilizing effects of Cs⁺ with the favorable optoelectronic properties of organic cations. However, the high instability index suggests that this particular ratio may not achieve optimal stability. Further investigation into alternative cation ratios, potential incorporation of mixed halides, or passivation strategies would be recommended to improve the long-term stability while maintaining desirable optoelectronic properties.","Report: # Compositional Analysis of Mixed-Cation Perovskite and Stability Implications

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite represents a binary Cs/FA mixed-cation system with complete absence of the MA cation. The incorporation of Cs⁺ (ionic radius ~167 pm) alongside the larger FA⁺ cation (~253 pm) likely influences the Goldschmidt tolerance factor of the resulting perovskite structure. This combination may create a more balanced structural framework compared to single-cation systems.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The absence of MA⁺ cations eliminates a common degradation pathway, as MA⁺ is known to be susceptible to thermal degradation and moisture-induced decomposition. However, the predominance of FA⁺ (82%) may introduce some vulnerability to phase instability, as pure FAPbI₃ typically exhibits a phase transition to a non-photoactive δ-phase at room temperature.

The moderate Cs⁺ content (18%) likely serves to stabilize the photoactive black phase of the perovskite by:
1. Reducing lattice strain through partial accommodation of the smaller Cs⁺ ions
2. Potentially suppressing the phase transition tendencies of the FA-rich composition
3. Improving thermal stability compared to MA-containing formulations

### Potential Stability Implications
The relatively high instability index (27122.0) suggests that despite the Cs⁺ incorporation, this particular composition may still face stability challenges. This could be attributed to:
- Insufficient Cs⁺ content to fully stabilize the FA-rich structure
- Possible phase segregation under operational conditions
- Vulnerability to moisture ingress at the specific Cs/FA ratio employed

### Cation Size Effects
The composition features a binary mixture of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius, ~1.67 Å) and FA⁺ (larger ionic radius, ~2.53 Å) cations at the A-site position. The absence of MA⁺ (intermediate radius, ~2.17 Å) creates a bimodal size distribution rather than a continuous gradient of cation sizes.

### Tolerance Factor Implications

The absence of the highly hygroscopic MA⁺ cation may partially mitigate moisture sensitivity, while the presence of Cs⁺ (20%) could provide some improvement in moisture resistance.

### Thermal Stability
The incorporation of inorganic Cs⁺ (20%) should enhance thermal stability compared to purely organic-cation perovskites, as Cs⁺ is not susceptible to thermal degradation. However, the dominant FA⁺ component may still undergo thermal decomposition at elevated temperatures.

### Ion Migration Potential
The binary cation mixture may create channels or pathways with varying activation energies for ion migration. The size mismatch between Cs⁺ and FA⁺ could potentially create interstitial spaces facilitating halide migration, which may affect long-term operational stability.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following composition:
- CsPbI₃: 38%
- FAPbI₃: 62%
- MAPbI₃: 0%

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### Cation Size Effects
The sample contains a binary mixture of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius, ~1.67 Å) and FA⁺ (larger ionic radius, ~2.53 Å) cations, with complete absence of MA⁺ (~2.17 Å). This composition creates a distribution of A-site cations with significantly different sizes, potentially affecting the Goldschmidt tolerance factor of the perovskite structure.

### Lattice Distortion
The size mismatch between Cs⁺ and FA⁺ likely induces lattice strain within the crystal structure. While FA⁺ tends to expand the lattice, Cs⁺ contracts it. This strain may create local distortions in the PbI₆ octahedra, potentially affecting optoelectronic properties and structural stability.

### Chemical Stability Considerations
The absence of MA⁺ eliminates one potential degradation pathway, as MA⁺ is known to be thermally unstable and prone to volatilization. However, the FA⁺ component (62%) may still present stability challenges due to its susceptibility to humidity-induced degradation.

### Phase Stability
Pure CsPbI₃ typically forms a yellow non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature, while FAPbI₃ tends toward a yellow δ-phase under ambient conditions. The mixture may help stabilize the black perovskite α-phase through entropy stabilization, though the relatively high instability index suggests potential phase segregation or incomplete phase stabilization.

## Conclusion
The binary Cs/FA composition represents a compromise between the thermal stability offered by Cs⁺ and the favorable bandgap properties of FA⁺. However, the high instability index suggests that this particular ratio may not achieve optimal phase stability. Further investigation into phase behavior under various environmental conditions is recommended to fully characterize the stability limitations of this composition.","Report: # Experimental Report: Compositional Analysis of Mixed-Cation Perovskite

- FAPbI₃: 0.47 (47%)
- MAPbI₃: 0.00 (0%)
- Measured instability index: 318,600.0

## Discussion of Structural and Chemical Properties

The examined perovskite represents a binary cation mixture with Cs⁺ and FA⁺ (formamidinium) occupying the A-site position in the ABX₃ perovskite structure, while completely excluding MA⁺ (methylammonium).

### Structural Considerations
The combination of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius) and FA⁺ (larger ionic radius) likely affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which is critical for structural stability. The absence of the intermediate-sized MA⁺ cation creates a bimodal distribution of A-site cation sizes rather than a more graduated distribution.

### Chemical Stability Implications
1. **Cs-FA Interaction**: The significant proportion of CsPbI₃ (53%) may help stabilize the cubic phase of the perovskite, as pure FAPbI₃ tends to form a yellow hexagonal phase at room temperature.

2. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The complete absence of MA⁺ eliminates one potential degradation pathway, as MA⁺ is known to be particularly susceptible to moisture-induced degradation.

3. **Thermal Considerations**: The high Cs⁺ content likely improves thermal stability compared to formamidinium-only compositions, as Cs⁺ has no organic components that could degrade at elevated temperatures.

4. **Phase Segregation Risk**: Binary mixtures may be more prone to phase segregation under operational conditions compared to triple-cation formulations.

## Conclusion
The high instability index (318,600.0) suggests potential stability challenges despite the theoretically favorable aspects of the Cs-FA mixture. This could indicate that the specific ratio (0.53:0.47) may not be optimal for maximizing the stabilizing effects of the mixed-cation approach.

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### A-site Cation Effects
The sample contains a binary mixture of Cs⁺ and FA⁺ cations at the A-site position, with complete absence of MA⁺. This composition leverages the complementary properties of both cations:

1. **Cesium (Cs⁺)** - The predominant cation (59%) provides:
   - Smaller ionic radius (1.67 Å) compared to FA⁺
   - Enhanced thermal stability
   - Potential for improved crystallinity

2. **Formamidinium (FA⁺)** - The secondary cation (41%) contributes:
   - Larger ionic radius (2.53 Å)
   - Favorable bandgap properties
   - More polarizable nature

### Structural Considerations
The absence of MA⁺ is notable as methylammonium is often associated with moisture sensitivity and thermal instability due to its volatile nature. The Cs/FA mixture likely creates a more robust crystal structure through:

- **Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor**: The combination may optimize the tolerance factor toward the ideal value of 1, potentially reducing lattice distortion
- **Octahedral Tilting**: The mixed A-site cations could reduce PbI₆ octahedral tilting, enhancing structural stability

### Potential Stability Mechanisms
The relatively high instability index (225,170.0) suggests challenges remain despite the optimized composition. Possible factors affecting stability include:

- **Phase Segregation**: Potential for Cs-rich and FA-rich domains to form over time
- **Iodide Vulnerability**: The all-iodide composition lacks the stabilizing effect of mixed halides
- **Surface Defects**: High surface defect concentration may contribute to degradation pathways

## Conclusion
This Cs₀.₅₉FA₀.₄₁PbI₃ composition represents an approach to balance structural stability with optoelectronic performance through A-site cation engineering. While the complete elimination of MA⁺ removes one source of instability, the high instability index suggests other degradation mechanisms remain active.

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite is predominantly composed of formamidinium (FA) cations with minor contributions from cesium (Cs) and methylammonium (MA) cations. This triple-cation approach represents a common strategy to modulate perovskite properties.

The high FA content (89%) likely dominates the structural characteristics. FA-based perovskites typically exhibit a larger tolerance factor due to the larger ionic radius of FA⁺ compared to MA⁺ and Cs⁺, potentially allowing better accommodation within the lead-iodide octahedral framework.

The small Cs⁺ inclusion (10%) may help stabilize the crystal structure by reducing lattice strain and suppressing phase transitions. However, the relatively low concentration might be insufficient to fully realize these benefits.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The minimal MA content (1%) is noteworthy, as MA⁺ is generally considered the least stable cation among the three due to its volatility and susceptibility to degradation under thermal and environmental stresses.

The high FA content, while beneficial for optoelectronic properties, may present challenges for stability as pure FAPbI₃ naturally tends toward a non-perovskite hexagonal phase at room temperature.

The observed composition represents a predominantly FA-based perovskite with significant Cs incorporation and minimal MA content. This compositional strategy likely aims to balance several competing factors affecting stability:

1. **Tolerance Factor Effects**: The incorporation of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius) alongside FA⁺ (larger ionic radius) may help achieve an optimal tolerance factor, potentially reducing lattice strain and improving structural stability.

2. **Phase Stability**: Pure FAPbI₃ typically suffers from phase instability at room temperature, tending to transform from the photoactive α-phase (black) to the non-photoactive δ-phase (yellow). The significant Cs⁺ content (32%) may help stabilize the photoactive phase.

3. **Minimal MA Content**: The very low MA⁺ concentration (1%) suggests an intentional reduction of this cation, which is known to be thermally unstable and susceptible to degradation under heat and humidity.

## Potential Stability Implications

The high instability index (383479.0) suggests potential concerns regarding long-term stability. This could be attributed to:

- Possible incomplete phase stabilization despite the mixed-cation approach
- Potential ion segregation or phase separation under operational conditions
- Iodide-based composition, which is generally more susceptible to degradation than bromide or mixed-halide systems

## Recommendations

Further investigation is recommended to:
1. Evaluate phase purity using XRD analysis
2. Assess thermal stability through TGA/DSC measurements
3. Conduct humidity stability tests under controlled conditions
4. Consider slight compositional modifications, potentially increasing Cs⁺ content or introducing small amounts of bromide to enhance stability

This compositional strategy represents a common approach in perovskite research, attempting to leverage the beneficial properties of multiple A-site cations while mitigating their individual shortcomings.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following A-site cation distribution:
- Cs⁺: 18%
- FA⁺ (formamidinium): 78%
- MA⁺ (methylammonium): 4%

## Results and Discussion
The examined perovskite demonstrates a predominantly FA-based composition with significant Cs incorporation and minimal MA content. This compositional profile has several implications for material properties:

The high FA⁺ content (78%) likely contributes to favorable optoelectronic properties, as FAPbI₃ typically exhibits a desirable bandgap (~1.48 eV) and good charge transport characteristics. However, pure FAPbI₃ is known to suffer from phase instability at room temperature, tending to transform from the photoactive α-phase to the non-photoactive δ-phase.

The incorporation of 18% Cs⁺ is significant and likely serves as a stabilizing agent. Cs⁺, with its smaller ionic radius compared to FA⁺, can help suppress the phase transition to the δ-phase by inducing lattice contraction and enhancing the Goldschmidt tolerance factor toward optimal values.

The minimal MA⁺ content (4%) suggests an intentional reduction of this cation, which is beneficial as MA⁺ is known to be thermally unstable and susceptible to volatilization at elevated temperatures.

## Stability Considerations
The high instability index (147202.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability despite the compositional engineering. This could be attributed to:

1. The still-dominant FA⁺ content may not be sufficiently stabilized by the Cs⁺ incorporation
2. Potential ion migration pathways that remain accessible in this composition

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The sample is predominantly composed of formamidinium (FA) lead iodide with minor additions of cesium (Cs) and methylammonium (MA) cations. This triple-cation approach represents a common strategy to modulate perovskite properties.

The high FA content (85%) likely dominates the structural characteristics. FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (2.53 Å) compared to MA⁺ (2.17 Å) and Cs⁺ (1.81 Å), which affects the tolerance factor of the perovskite structure. The predominance of FA⁺ may lead to a more expansive lattice with potentially reduced octahedral tilting.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The high proportion of FAPbI₃ is noteworthy as pure FAPbI₃ is known to exhibit phase instability at room temperature, with a tendency to transform from the photoactive black α-phase to the non-photoactive yellow δ-phase. The incorporation of Cs⁺ (9%) likely serves as a stabilizing agent for the α-phase through lattice contraction.

The relatively low MA⁺ content (6%) may be insufficient to provide significant stabilization against humidity-induced degradation, as MA⁺ is particularly susceptible to moisture. However, its presence in small quantities may help optimize the bandgap and optoelectronic properties.

### Potential Stability Implications
The high instability index (192477.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This could be attributed to:

1. The dominant FA⁺ content may not be sufficiently stabilized by the relatively low Cs⁺ incorporation
2. The minimal MA⁺ content provides limited contribution to structural stability while potentially introducing a moisture-sensitive component
3. The specific ratio may result in lattice strain or incomplete phase stabilization

- MAPbI₃: 0.11 (11%)
- Measured instability index: 208,028.0

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite represents a triple-cation system with FA⁺ as the dominant A-site cation. The incorporation of multiple cations with different ionic radii (Cs⁺ < MA⁺ < FA⁺) likely influences the overall tolerance factor of the perovskite structure. The relatively high proportion of FA⁺ (69%) may contribute to a more favorable tolerance factor, potentially enhancing structural stability compared to single-cation systems.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The presence of Cs⁺ (20%) could contribute to structural rigidity due to its inorganic nature and smaller ionic radius, potentially improving thermal stability. However, the dominance of organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺ totaling 80%) may still render the material susceptible to degradation mechanisms including:

1. Moisture sensitivity - particularly from the hygroscopic nature of MA⁺
2. Thermal instability - especially concerning the MA⁺ component which is known to be thermally labile
3. Phase segregation risks - due to the mixed-cation nature

### Stability Implications
The relatively high instability index (208,028.0) suggests potential concerns regarding long-term operational stability. The moderate Cs⁺ content may be insufficient to fully stabilize the structure against environmental stressors. The high FA⁺ content, while beneficial for optoelectronic properties, may contribute to phase instability under certain conditions.

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite represents a mixed-cation system with FA⁺ (formamidinium) as the dominant A-site cation. The incorporation of multiple cations with different ionic radii (Cs⁺ < MA⁺ < FA⁺) likely influences the overall tolerance factor of the perovskite structure. The relatively high proportion of FA⁺ may contribute to a more favorable tolerance factor, potentially enhancing the crystallinity of the material.

### Chemical Stability Factors
The high FA⁺ content (70%) could introduce both advantages and challenges. While FA⁺ typically promotes favorable optoelectronic properties and bandgap characteristics, pure FAPbI₃ is known to undergo phase transitions to a non-photoactive δ-phase at room temperature. The incorporation of Cs⁺ (16%) likely serves as a stabilizing agent that can help suppress this phase transition through lattice contraction.

The relatively low MA⁺ content (14%) may be beneficial for stability, as methylammonium is generally more susceptible to thermal degradation and moisture-induced decomposition compared to the other cations.

### Potential Stability Implications
The high instability index value suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This could be attributed to several factors:

1. The dominant FA⁺ content may still allow for some phase instability despite the Cs⁺ inclusion.
2. The triple-cation system introduces lattice strain due to the different ionic radii, potentially creating defect sites susceptible to degradation pathways.
3. The iodide-based composition (PbI₃) is generally more prone to oxidation and halide migration compared to bromide or mixed-halide systems.

2. **Thermal Stability**: The moderate Cs⁺ content (27%) provides some thermal stability enhancement, but may be insufficient to fully counterbalance the lower thermal stability of MA⁺-rich regions.

3. **Phase Segregation Risk**: The three-cation mixture could experience phase segregation under operational conditions, particularly at interfaces or grain boundaries.

4. **Ion Migration Pathways**: The varied cation sizes create different local lattice environments that may facilitate ion migration, potentially accelerating degradation mechanisms.

## Recommendations for Further Investigation
- XRD analysis to determine phase purity and crystal structure
- Temperature-dependent stability tests (25-85°C)
- Humidity exposure tests (30-80% RH)
- Photoluminescence measurements to assess optoelectronic properties
- SEM/TEM imaging to evaluate film morphology and potential phase segregation

The high instability index value suggests that this particular composition may require additional stabilization strategies such as surface passivation or encapsulation for practical applications.

- CsPbI₃: 13 mol%
- FAPbI₃: 87 mol%
- MAPbI₃: 0 mol%
- Measured instability index: 23707.0

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### Cation Size Effects
The mixed-cation perovskite incorporates two A-site cations with different ionic radii: Cs⁺ (smaller) and FA⁺ (larger). This combination likely affects the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which is critical for structural stability. The absence of the intermediate-sized MA⁺ cation creates a binary rather than ternary cation system.

### Lattice Distortion
The significant proportion of FA⁺ (87%) may introduce lattice distortion due to its larger size. While this can enhance light absorption properties, it may also contribute to phase instability, particularly under environmental stressors.

### Phase Stability Considerations
FAPbI₃ is known to exist in two phases: the photoactive α-phase (black) and the non-photoactive δ-phase (yellow). The relatively high instability index (23707.0) suggests that this composition may be prone to phase segregation or transformation under operational conditions.

### Chemical Stability
The absence of MA⁺ eliminates potential degradation pathways associated with methylammonium's thermal instability. However, the high FA⁺ content may still present vulnerability to moisture-induced degradation through hydrogen bonding interactions.

## Implications for Long-term Stability

The Cs⁺ inclusion (13%) likely serves as a stabilizing agent for the photoactive phase, but the dominance of FA⁺ may compromise long-term stability. The high instability index suggests that this particular composition may benefit from further optimization, potentially through:

1. Increasing the Cs⁺ content to improve structural rigidity
2. Incorporating small amounts of MA⁺ or other cations to optimize the tolerance factor
3. Exploring halide mixing (e.g., Br⁻ partial substitution) to enhance structural stability

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### Cation Size Effects
The sample contains a binary mixture of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius, ~1.67 Å) and FA⁺ (larger ionic radius, ~2.53 Å) cations, with FA⁺ being the dominant component. The absence of MA⁺ (intermediate ionic radius, ~2.17 Å) is notable. This composition creates a bimodal distribution of A-site cations rather than a gradient of sizes.

### Tolerance Factor Implications

The relatively large size of FA⁺ likely pushes the tolerance factor toward the upper boundary of stability (t > 0.8 and < 1.0), potentially affecting octahedral tilting in the crystal structure.

### Potential Stability Factors
1. **Phase Stability**: The high FA⁺ content may promote the formation of the black α-phase, but could be susceptible to phase transitions under environmental stressors.

2. **Moisture Sensitivity**: FA⁺-rich compositions typically show moderate hygroscopicity. The partial substitution with Cs⁺ may provide some improvement in moisture resistance compared to pure FAPbI₃, but the high FA⁺ content suggests moisture sensitivity remains a concern.

3. **Thermal Stability**: The incorporation of Cs⁺ likely enhances thermal stability compared to pure FAPbI₃, as Cs⁺ has stronger ionic bonding within the perovskite framework.

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite consists primarily of formamidinium (FA) cations with a smaller proportion of cesium (Cs) cations in the A-site position. This mixed-cation approach is notable for several reasons:

1. **Tolerance Factor Effects**: The incorporation of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius) alongside FA⁺ (larger ionic radius) likely modifies the overall Goldschmidt tolerance factor of the structure. While pure FAPbI₃ tends toward a tolerance factor slightly above the ideal range, the addition of Cs⁺ may help bring this value closer to optimal.

2. **Phase Stability**: Pure FAPbI₃ is known to exhibit polymorphism, with the yellow δ-phase often competing with the desired black α-phase at room temperature. The high FA content (87%) suggests the material may retain some tendency toward phase instability.

3. **Lattice Distortion**: The significant size difference between Cs⁺ and FA⁺ cations may introduce local lattice distortions that could affect carrier transport properties and recombination dynamics.

### Chemical Stability Considerations

1. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The high FA content may contribute to moisture sensitivity, as FA-based perovskites typically show greater susceptibility to humidity-induced degradation compared to Cs-based variants.

2. **Thermal Stability**: The incorporation of Cs⁺ (13%) likely provides some enhancement to thermal stability compared to pure FAPbI₃, though the effect may be limited by the relatively low Cs⁺ concentration.

3. **Ion Migration**: The absence of MA⁺ cations eliminates one potential source of ion migration (typically more mobile than FA⁺ or Cs⁺), which could be beneficial for operational stability.

2. **Moisture Sensitivity**: FA-rich compositions typically exhibit vulnerability to moisture due to the hygroscopic nature of the formamidinium cation.

3. **Limited Cs⁺ Stabilization**: While Cs⁺ incorporation (17%) may provide some structural rigidity, this proportion might be insufficient to fully stabilize the FA-dominant structure against phase transitions.

4. **Minimal MA⁺ Content**: The low MA⁺ percentage (3%) likely has minimal impact on stability, though it may slightly influence the bandgap.

## Recommendations
Based on the compositional analysis, the following modifications could potentially improve stability:

1. Increase the Cs⁺ content to enhance structural stability
2. Consider partial substitution of I⁻ with Br⁻ to optimize tolerance factor
3. Explore passivation strategies to mitigate surface-initiated degradation

Further characterization through XRD, thermal stability testing, and humidity exposure experiments would provide valuable insights into the specific degradation mechanisms affecting this composition.

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following compositional ratios:
- CsPbI₃: 0.17
- FAPbI₃: 0.80
- MAPbI₃: 0.03

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite represents a mixed-cation system with formamidinium (FA) as the dominant A-site cation. The composition features a significant cesium (Cs) fraction and minimal methylammonium (MA) content. This distribution may influence the crystal structure in several ways:

1. **Tolerance Factor**: The varying ionic radii of the A-site cations (Cs⁺ < MA⁺ < FA⁺) likely create a composite tolerance factor that affects lattice distortion and octahedral tilting in the PbI₆ framework.

2. **Crystal Phase Stability**: The high FA content (0.80) may promote the formation of the black α-phase desired for optoelectronic applications, while the Cs fraction (0.17) could help stabilize this phase by reducing lattice distortion.

### Chemical Stability Considerations

1. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The high FA content may contribute to moisture sensitivity, as FAPbI₃ is known to be vulnerable to humidity-induced degradation. The relatively low MA content (0.03) is beneficial as MA-based perovskites typically show higher hygroscopicity.

2. **Thermal Stability**: The incorporation of Cs (0.17) likely enhances thermal stability compared to pure FA or MA perovskites, as Cs has stronger ionic bonding within the lattice.

3. **Phase Segregation Risk**: The multi-cation composition may be susceptible to phase segregation under operational conditions, particularly given the dominance of a single cation (FA at 0.80).

## Potential Stability Implications

The high instability index (119938.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This could be attributed to:

1. The dominant FA content, which may not be sufficiently stabilized by the Cs and MA fractions
2. Possible lattice strain arising from the incorporation of cations with different sizes
3. Potential vulnerability to environmental factors such as moisture, oxygen, or heat

## Conclusion

The analyzed perovskite composition features a FA-dominant structure with moderate Cs incorporation and minimal MA content.

The relatively high FA⁺ content may promote a more cubic-like structure with potentially fewer distortions.

### Thermal Stability
The incorporation of Cs⁺ (13%) may enhance thermal stability compared to pure FAPbI₃, as Cs⁺ has been documented to improve structural rigidity. However, the relatively low Cs⁺ content might limit this stabilizing effect. The minimal MA⁺ content (8%) is beneficial since MA⁺ is typically associated with thermal instability due to its volatile nature.

### Moisture Sensitivity
The high FA⁺ content may contribute to moisture sensitivity, as FAPbI₃ is generally more susceptible to humidity-induced degradation than CsPbI₃. The low proportion of Cs⁺, which typically enhances moisture resistance, might be insufficient to significantly mitigate this vulnerability.

### Phase Stability
The mixed-cation approach should theoretically enhance phase stability through entropic stabilization. However, the strong dominance of a single cation (FA⁺) might reduce this entropic advantage compared to more evenly distributed compositions.

## Potential Stability Implications

The relatively high instability index (55524.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability. This could be attributed to:

1. The dominant FA⁺ content may lead to phase instability issues, as pure FAPbI₃ tends to transition to a non-photoactive δ-phase at room temperature.

2. The low Cs⁺ content might be insufficient to adequately suppress phase transitions or enhance moisture resistance.

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

The examined perovskite represents a triple-cation system with FA⁺ as the dominant A-site cation. This compositional profile may influence several key properties:

### Structural Considerations
The high FA⁺ content (79%) likely dominates the structural characteristics. FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius (253 pm) compared to MA⁺ (217 pm) and Cs⁺ (167 pm), which affects the tolerance factor and octahedral tilting in the perovskite structure. The relatively low Cs⁺ content (13%) may be insufficient to fully stabilize the cubic phase through appropriate tuning of the effective cation radius.

### Chemical Stability Factors
1. The high proportion of organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺, totaling 87%) may contribute to moisture sensitivity, as these organic components are generally more susceptible to hydrolysis than the inorganic Cs⁺.

2. The low MA⁺ content (8%) is potentially beneficial, as MA⁺ is typically the least thermally stable cation among the three, prone to volatilization at elevated temperatures.

3. The relatively low Cs⁺ incorporation may limit the stabilization effect that this inorganic cation typically provides against phase segregation and thermal degradation.

### Potential Stability Implications
The high instability index (93928.0) suggests significant vulnerability to degradation pathways. This may be attributed to:

- Suboptimal cation ratio for achieving a stable tolerance factor
- Insufficient Cs⁺ content to adequately suppress phase segregation
- Predominance of the more hygroscopic FA⁺ cation
- Potential for phase transitions due to the mixed-cation composition

## Conclusion
The analyzed perovskite composition exhibits a high FA⁺ content with relatively low proportions of Cs⁺ and MA⁺. This compositional profile, combined with the high instability index, suggests that the material may benefit from compositional optimization to enhance long-term stability. Further investigation into phase behavior, moisture resistance, and thermal stability is recommended to establish clear composition-stability relationships.","Report: # Experimental Report: Compositional Analysis of Mixed-Cation Perovskite

## Discussion of Composition-Property Relationships

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite is predominantly composed of formamidinium (FA) cations, with smaller proportions of cesium (Cs) and methylammonium (MA) cations. This mixed-cation approach is consistent with current strategies to optimize perovskite properties through compositional engineering.

The high FA content (79%) likely influences the crystal structure significantly. FA⁺ has a larger ionic radius than both MA⁺ and Cs⁺, which typically results in a more favorable tolerance factor for the perovskite structure. However, pure FAPbI₃ is known to be thermodynamically unstable at room temperature, often converting to a non-photoactive δ-phase.

### Stability Implications
The incorporation of 13% Cs⁺ may provide some stabilizing effect by:
- Reducing lattice strain through appropriate size matching
- Potentially suppressing phase segregation
- Enhancing thermal stability due to the inorganic nature of Cs⁺

The relatively low MA⁺ content (8%) could be beneficial for stability as MA⁺ is:
- More susceptible to thermal degradation
- Prone to volatilization under environmental stressors
- More hygroscopic than Cs⁺

### Chemical Considerations
The all-iodide composition (PbI₃) suggests:
- A narrower bandgap compared to bromide or mixed-halide variants
- Potentially higher susceptibility to iodide migration and volatilization
- Greater sensitivity to oxidative environments

## Conclusion
The triple-cation composition with FA-dominant character represents a balance between favorable optoelectronic properties and structural stability.

The sample is predominantly composed of formamidinium (FA) cations with smaller proportions of methylammonium (MA) and cesium (Cs). This mixed-cation approach is consistent with established strategies to enhance perovskite stability through cation engineering.

### Potential Stability Factors
1. **Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor**: The incorporation of Cs⁺ (smaller ionic radius) alongside FA⁺ (larger ionic radius) likely modulates the overall tolerance factor toward the ideal range for stable perovskite formation.

2. **Phase Stabilization**: The high FA⁺ content (78.85%) may introduce challenges, as pure FAPbI₃ typically exhibits a yellow non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature. The presence of Cs⁺ and MA⁺ could help stabilize the photoactive black α-phase.

3. **Humidity Resistance**: The relatively low proportion of hygroscopic MA⁺ (16.15%) may reduce moisture sensitivity compared to traditional MAPbI₃ formulations.

4. **Thermal Stability**: The inclusion of Cs⁺, even at low concentration (5%), could enhance thermal stability by strengthening the lattice through its higher charge density and smaller size.

## Potential Instability Mechanisms

The high instability index (258154.0) suggests potential structural vulnerabilities that may arise from:

1. **Phase Segregation**: The significant compositional asymmetry (FA-rich) might lead to cation segregation under operational conditions.

### Structural Considerations
The examined perovskite represents a mixed-cation system with FA⁺ (formamidinium) as the dominant A-site cation. The relatively low proportion of Cs⁺ (5%) suggests this composition aims to leverage the beneficial properties of FA-rich perovskites while incorporating stabilizing elements.

FA-dominant compositions typically exhibit favorable optoelectronic properties including:
- Narrower bandgap (~1.48 eV) compared to MA-based perovskites
- Potentially higher charge carrier mobility
- Better light absorption in the near-infrared region

### Stability Implications
Several compositional factors may contribute to the observed instability index:

1. **Limited Cs⁺ incorporation:** The low Cs⁺ content (5%) may be insufficient to fully stabilize the crystal structure. Cesium typically enhances thermal stability and reduces phase segregation in mixed perovskites.

2. **High FA⁺ content (78.85%):** While beneficial for optoelectronic properties, high FA⁺ concentrations can lead to:
   - Phase instability due to the larger ionic radius of FA⁺
   - Potential formation of the yellow δ-phase under thermal or humidity stress
   - Increased susceptibility to moisture-induced degradation

3. **Intermediate MA⁺ content (16.15%):** The moderate MA⁺ proportion may provide some structural stabilization but MA⁺ is known to be thermally volatile and susceptible to degradation.

### Chemical Considerations
The all-iodide composition (lacking bromide incorporation) may contribute to reduced stability as mixed-halide systems often demonstrate enhanced structural integrity. However, single-halide compositions avoid halide segregation issues that can occur in mixed-halide systems.

The Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which depends on ionic radii ratios, is likely influenced by the predominance of the larger FA⁺ cation. The relatively low Cs⁺ content may provide insufficient lattice contraction to fully optimize the tolerance factor.

### Phase Stability Considerations
Pure FAPbI₃ typically exhibits phase instability at room temperature, tending to transform from the photoactive α-phase (black) to the non-photoactive δ-phase (yellow). The high FA⁺ content (78.85%) in this composition may contribute to potential phase instability.

The incorporation of Cs⁺ and MA⁺ cations typically helps stabilize the photoactive phase through:
- Entropy stabilization via cation mixing
- Lattice strain modulation
- Suppression of phase transitions

However, the relatively low Cs⁺ content (5%) may be insufficient to fully stabilize the structure against phase segregation or transformation.

### Chemical Stability Factors
MA⁺ cations are known to be vulnerable to thermal and moisture degradation due to their organic nature and volatility. The moderate MA⁺ content (16.15%) may introduce some vulnerability to environmental factors.

The high FA⁺ content, while beneficial for optical properties, may contribute to moisture sensitivity, as FA⁺ can undergo deprotonation under humid conditions.

## Structural and Chemical Considerations

### A-site Cation Distribution
The perovskite contains three different A-site cations (Cs⁺, FA⁺, MA⁺) with varying ionic radii (Cs⁺ < MA⁺ < FA⁺). This mixed-cation approach typically aims to optimize the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which is critical for structural stability.

### Potential Stability Factors
1. **Cation Size Effects**: The smaller Cs⁺ cations (26% of composition) may help counterbalance the larger FA⁺ cations (38%), potentially reducing lattice strain.

2. **Moisture Sensitivity**: The relatively high proportion of organic cations (FA⁺ and MA⁺, totaling 74%) may increase susceptibility to moisture-induced degradation, as these organic components are generally more hygroscopic than inorganic Cs⁺.

3. **Thermal Stability**: The inclusion of Cs⁺ (26%) likely enhances thermal stability compared to purely organic formulations, though the predominance of organic cations may still limit high-temperature resilience.

4. **Phase Segregation Risk**: The near-equal proportions of MA⁺ and FA⁺ could potentially lead to phase segregation under operational conditions, particularly under illumination or thermal stress.

## Conclusion
The high instability index (541686.0) reported for this composition suggests significant stability challenges. The relatively low Cs⁺ content compared to organic cations may be insufficient to adequately stabilize the crystal structure against environmental stressors. Further investigation into phase behavior under operational conditions would be valuable to understand the degradation mechanisms and potential strategies for stability enhancement.","Report: # Compositional Analysis of Mixed-Cation Perovskite and Stability Implications

## Composition Analysis
The perovskite sample under investigation has the following cation distribution:
- CsPbI₃: 26%
- FAPbI₃: 38% 
- MAPbI₃: 36%

## Discussion of Compositional Effects on Stability

The mixed-cation approach employed in this sample represents a strategy to balance the properties of individual perovskite components. The relatively high instability index (593083.0) suggests potential challenges with long-term stability that may be related to the specific compositional ratio.

The incorporation of Cs⁺ (26%) provides some structural rigidity due to its inorganic nature and smaller ionic radius compared to the organic cations. However, this proportion may be insufficient to fully stabilize the structure against phase transitions that pure CsPbI₃ typically undergoes at room temperature.

The dominant organic cations (FA⁺ at 38% and MA⁺ at 36%) likely contribute to favorable optoelectronic properties but may introduce vulnerability to environmental factors. The similar proportions of these organic components could create competing structural influences:

1. The larger FA⁺ cation typically expands the perovskite lattice, potentially reducing octahedral tilting.
2. The smaller MA⁺ cation is more susceptible to thermal vibrations and may facilitate moisture ingress.

The near-equal distribution between organic cations might create local structural heterogeneity that could serve as nucleation points for degradation pathways, particularly under thermal or humidity stress.

## Conclusion

This triple-cation composition demonstrates an attempt to balance stability and performance through cation mixing. The high instability index suggests that this particular ratio may not achieve optimal structural stability.

## Analysis and Discussion
The pure methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI₃) composition exhibits a notably high instability index (1,413,800.0), which aligns with established literature on single-cation perovskites. Several structural and chemical factors likely contribute to this instability:

1. **Organic Cation Volatility**: The methylammonium (MA⁺) cation is relatively small (ionic radius ~2.17Å) and volatile, making it susceptible to thermal degradation and evaporation, particularly at elevated temperatures.

2. **Hydrogen Bonding Network**: MA⁺ forms hydrogen bonds with the iodide ions in the perovskite framework. While these interactions can stabilize the structure at room temperature, they are relatively weak and can be disrupted by environmental factors.

3. **Tolerance Factor Considerations**: MAPbI₃ has a tolerance factor close to the stability limit for perovskite structures, making it structurally less robust compared to mixed-cation formulations.

4. **Phase transitions**: Pure MAPbI₃ undergoes phase transitions at relatively low temperatures (~57°C), which can compromise structural integrity during thermal cycling.

5. **Chemical vulnerability**: The MA⁺ cation contains C-N bonds that are susceptible to degradation when exposed to moisture, oxygen, and UV radiation.
