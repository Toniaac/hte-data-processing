# Recommendation for Next Experiment

Based on the single data point provided (Experiment #49), I recommend the following parameters for the next experiment to potentially maximize the elastic modulus:

- **Auto**: Yes (continue with automated synthesis for consistency)
- **Heating**: Yes (introduce heating during solution preparation)
- **Concentration**: 19% (increase polymer concentration)
- **Heating block temperature**: 40°C
- **Mixed**: No (continue with manual premixing as in the successful experiment)
- **Rest time**: 1 day (introduce rest time to allow better polymer chain organization)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 8 minutes (slightly shorter than previous 10 minutes)
- **Relative Humidity**: 85% (slightly lower than previous 95%)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (maintain this parameter)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (add nitrogen flow after blade-casting)

## Rationale:
1. Higher polymer concentration (19%) should increase chain entanglement and potentially improve mechanical properties
2. Adding heating during preparation may improve polymer dissolution and distribution
3. Introducing a rest time of 1 day could allow better polymer chain organization
4. Maintaining nitrogen flow during drop-casting while adding it after blade-casting should provide more consistent protection from humidity
5. Slightly reducing humidity and wait time may help control the phase separation rate

Since we have limited data, this recommendation aims to explore parameters that typically influence mechanical properties in polymer membranes while maintaining some successful elements from the previous experiment.",197.84044623035882,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the two previous experiments (ID 49 and 50), I'll analyze the parameters that appear to influence the elastic modulus and recommend the next experimental setup.

## Analysis of Previous Results:
- Experiment 49: Modulus = 228.31 MPa (higher)
  - 17% polymer concentration
  - No heating (25°C)
  - Premixed solution
  - No rest time (0 days)
  - 10-minute coupon-to-bath wait time
  - 95% relative humidity
  - Nitrogen flow during drop-casting only
  - No nitrogen after blade-casting

- Experiment 50: Modulus = 197.84 MPa (lower)
  - 17% polymer concentration
  - No heating (25°C)
  - Premixed solution
  - No rest time (0 days)
  - 0.17-minute coupon-to-bath wait time
  - 70% relative humidity
  - No nitrogen during drop-casting
  - Nitrogen flow after blade-casting

## Key Observations:
1. The higher modulus (Exp 49) was achieved with:
   - Longer coupon-to-bath wait time (10 min vs 0.17 min)
   - Higher humidity (95% vs 70%)
   - Different nitrogen flow pattern (during drop-casting vs after blade-casting)

## Recommended Next Experiment:

- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature)
- **Concentration**: 18% (slightly increased from previous 17%)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C
- **Mixed**: No (manually premixed)
- **Rest time**: 0 days
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 12 minutes (extending beyond previous maximum)
- **Relative Humidity**: 95% (maintaining high humidity which showed better results)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes (as in the higher-modulus experiment)
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes (adding this to potentially further improve results)

This experiment builds on the conditions that produced the higher modulus while making strategic adjustments to potentially further enhance the mechanical properties of the membrane.",168.33383829683325,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the three previous experiments, I can identify several trends that appear to influence the elastic modulus:

## Key Observations:
1. The highest modulus (228.31) was achieved with:
   - 10-minute coupon-to-bath wait time
   - 95% relative humidity
   - Nitrogen flow during drop-casting only
   - No nitrogen flow after blade-casting

2. Decreasing wait time appears to decrease modulus:
   - 10 min wait → 228.31 modulus
   - 1 min wait → 168.33 modulus
   - 0.17 min wait → 197.84 modulus

3. All experiments used 17% polymer concentration and no heating.

## Recommended Next Experiment:

- **Auto**: Yes (automated synthesis)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature)
- **Concentration**: 18.5% (slight increase from previous 17%)
- **Heating block temperature**: 25°C
- **Mixed**: No (manually premixed)
- **Rest time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 12 minutes (increase from previous maximum)
- **Relative Humidity**: 95% (maintain high humidity)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: No

## Rationale:
This experiment builds on the highest-performing conditions while making strategic adjustments:
1. Increasing polymer concentration slightly to potentially enhance mechanical properties
2. Extending the wait time to further promote controlled phase separation
3. Maintaining the high humidity and nitrogen flow configuration that yielded the highest modulus

This approach follows the trend that longer wait times and higher humidity appear to favor higher modulus values while making incremental improvements to the best-performing conditions.",219.61643412334288,296.35081017123304,Continuing

Based on the prior observations, I recommend the following experimental parameters to maximize the elastic modulus:

## Experiment Parameters
- **Synthesis Method**: Automated robotic system (Auto: Yes)
- **Polymer Solution**: 17.0% polysulfone in PolarClean solvent (premixed manually) (Concentration: 17.0%)
- **Heating**: No (ambient temperature)
- **Heating Block Temperature**: 25°C
- **Mixed**: No (manually premixed)
- **Rest Time**: 0 days (use immediately)
- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 95%
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: Yes
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (228.31) was observed in Experiment 49, which had high humidity (95%) and a long wait time (10 minutes)
2. Experiment 55 with a 10-minute wait time also showed high modulus (219.62)
3. I'm combining the high humidity from Experiment 49 with nitrogen flow both during drop-casting and after blade-casting to provide maximum control over the evaporation environment
4. The 17% polymer concentration appears optimal across all experiments
5. Immediate use of the solution (0 days rest time) is maintained as it was consistent in the high-performing experiments

This combination of parameters should promote controlled solvent evaporation under high humidity conditions with maximum protection from environmental variations, which appears to favor higher modulus formation.",272.2240045816517,296.35081017123304,Continuing

- **Coupon-to-Bath Wait Time**: 10.0 minutes
- **Relative Humidity**: 50% (slightly lower than experiment #56)
- **Nitrogen (Side from drop)**: No
- **Nitrogen (After blade)**: Yes

## Rationale
1. The highest modulus (272.22) was observed in experiment #56, which used a 10-minute wait time before bath immersion at 58% RH.
2. Experiment #55 with similar parameters but higher humidity (68%) showed lower modulus (219.62).
3. Experiments with shorter wait times (#50, #51) showed significantly lower modulus values.
4. I'm recommending slightly lower humidity (50%) than experiment #56 to explore if reducing humidity further improves modulus, as there appears to be an inverse relationship between humidity and modulus in the available data.
5. Maintaining the 17% concentration, no heating, and nitrogen after blade casting (but not during side drop) follows the pattern of the best-performing experiment.

This experiment should help determine if the trend of increasing modulus with decreasing humidity continues while maintaining the optimal wait time of 10 minutes.",228.4671903908735,296.35081017123304,Continuing

4. I'm targeting a slightly lower humidity (55%) than experiment #56 (58%) to explore if reducing humidity further improves modulus while maintaining other key parameters.

5. The nitrogen flow after blade casting appears beneficial for higher modulus values, as seen in experiments #55 and #56.
